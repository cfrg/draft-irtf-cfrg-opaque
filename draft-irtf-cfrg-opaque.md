--- abstract

This document describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric
password-authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual
authentication in a client-server setting without reliance on PKI and
with security against pre-computation attacks upon server compromise.
In addition, the protocol provides forward secrecy and the ability to
hide the password from the server, even during password registration.
This document specifies the core OPAQUE protocol and one instantiation
based on 3DH.

# Introduction {#intro}

Password authentication is ubiquitous in many applications. In a common
implementation, a client authenticates to a server by sending its client
ID and password to the server over a secure connection. This makes
the password vulnerable to server mishandling, including accidentally
logging the password or storing it in plaintext in a database. Server
compromise resulting in access to these plaintext passwords is not an
uncommon security incident, even among security-conscious organizations.
Moreover, plaintext password authentication over secure channels such as
TLS is also vulnerable to cases where TLS may fail, including PKI
attacks, certificate mishandling, termination outside the security
perimeter, visibility to TLS-terminating intermediaries, and more.

Asymmetric (or Augmented) Password Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE)
protocols are designed to provide password authentication and
mutually authenticated key exchange in a client-server setting without
relying on PKI (except during client registration) and without
disclosing passwords to servers or other entities other than the client
machine. A secure aPAKE should provide the best possible security for a
password protocol. Indeed, some attacks are inevitable, such as
online impersonation attempts with guessed client passwords and offline
dictionary attacks upon the compromise of a server and leakage of its
credential file. In the latter case, the attacker learns a mapping of
a client's password under a one-way function and uses such a mapping to
validate potential guesses for the password. Crucially important is
for the password protocol to use an unpredictable one-way mapping.
Otherwise, the attacker can pre-compute a deterministic list of mapped
passwords leading to almost instantaneous leakage of passwords upon
server compromise.

This document describes OPAQUE, a PKI-free secure aPAKE that is secure
against pre-computation attacks. OPAQUE provides forward secrecy with
respect to password leakage while also hiding the password from the
server, even during password registration. OPAQUE allows applications
to increase the difficulty of offline dictionary attacks via iterated
hashing or other key stretching schemes. OPAQUE is also extensible, allowing
clients to safely store and retrieve arbitrary application data on servers
using only their password.

OPAQUE is defined and proven as the composition of three functionalities:
an oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF), a key recovery mechanism,
and an authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol. It can be seen
as a "compiler" for transforming any suitable AKE protocol into a secure
aPAKE protocol. (See {{security-considerations}} for requirements of the
OPRF and AKE protocols.) This document specifies one OPAQUE instantiation
based on {{3DH}}. Other instantiations are possible, as discussed in
{{alternate-akes}}, but their details are out of scope for this document.
In general, the modularity of OPAQUE's design makes it easy to integrate
with additional AKE protocols, e.g., TLS or HMQV, and with future ones such
as those based on post-quantum techniques.

OPAQUE consists of two stages: registration and authenticated key exchange.
In the first stage, a client registers its password with the server and stores
information used to recover authentication credentials on the server. Recovering these
credentials can only be done with knowledge of the client password. In the second
stage, a client uses its password to recover those credentials and subsequently
uses them as input to an AKE protocol. This stage has additional mechanisms to
prevent an active attacker from interacting with the server to guess or confirm
clients registered via the first phase. Servers can use this mechanism to safeguard
registered clients against this type of enumeration attack; see
{{preventing-client-enumeration}} for more discussion.

The name OPAQUE is a homonym of O-PAKE where O is for Oblivious. The name
OPAKE was taken.

This draft complies with the requirements for PAKE protocols set forth in
{{RFC8125}}.

## Requirements Notation

{::boilerplate bcp14}

## Notation {#notation}

The following functions are used throughout this document:

- I2OSP and OS2IP: Convert a byte string to and from a non-negative integer as
  described in Section 4 of {{?RFC8017}}. Note that these functions operate on
  byte strings in big-endian byte order.
- concat(x0, ..., xN): Concatenate byte strings. For example,
  `concat(0x01, 0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506`.
- random(n): Generate a cryptographically secure pseudorandom byte string of length `n` bytes.
- xor(a,b): Apply XOR to byte strings. For example, `xor(0xF0F0, 0x1234) = 0xE2C4`.
  It is an error to call this function with arguments of unequal length.
- ct_equal(a, b): Return `true` if `a` is equal to `b`, and false otherwise.
  The implementation of this function must be constant-time in the length of `a`
  and `b`, which are assumed to be of equal length, irrespective of the values `a`
  or `b`.

Except if said otherwise, random choices in this specification refer to
drawing with uniform distribution from a given set (i.e., "random" is short
for "uniformly random"). Random choices can be replaced with fresh outputs from
a cryptographically strong pseudorandom generator, according to the requirements
in {{!RFC4086}}, or pseudorandom function. For convenience, we define `nil` as a
lack of value.

All protocol messages and structures defined in this document use the syntax from
{{?RFC8446, Section 3}}.

# Cryptographic Dependencies {#dependencies}

OPAQUE depends on the following cryptographic protocols and primitives:

- Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF); {{deps-oprf}}
- Key Derivation Function (KDF); {{deps-symmetric}}
- Message Authentication Code (MAC); {{deps-symmetric}}
- Cryptographic Hash Function; {{deps-hash}}
- Key Stretching Function (KSF); {{deps-hash}}

This section describes these protocols and primitives in more detail. Unless said
otherwise, all random nonces and seeds used in these dependencies and the rest of
the OPAQUE protocol are of length `Nn` and `Nseed` bytes, respectively, where
`Nn` = `Nseed` = 32.

## Oblivious Pseudorandom Function {#deps-oprf}

An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between client and
server for computing a PRF such that the client learns the PRF output and neither party learns
the input of the other. This specification depends on the prime-order OPRF construction specified
in {{!OPRF=I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}, draft version -09, using the OPRF mode (0x00) from {{OPRF, Section 3.1}}.

The following OPRF client APIs are used:

- Blind(element): Create and output (`blind`, `blinded_element`), consisting of a blinded
  representation of input `element`, denoted `blinded_element`, along with a value to revert
  the blinding process, denoted `blind`.
- Finalize(element, blind, evaluated_element): Finalize the OPRF evaluation using input `element`,
  random inverter `blind`, and evaluation output `evaluated_element`, yielding output `oprf_output`.

Moreover, the following OPRF server APIs are used:

- Evaluate(k, blinded_element): Evaluate blinded input element `blinded_element` using
  input key `k`, yielding output element `evaluated_element`. This is equivalent to
  the Evaluate function described in {{OPRF, Section 3.3.1}}, where `k` is the private key parameter.
- DeriveKeyPair(seed, info): Derive a private and public key pair deterministically
  from a seed and info parameter, as described in {{OPRF, Section 3.2}}.

Finally, this specification makes use of the following shared APIs and parameters:

- SerializeElement(element): Map input `element` to a fixed-length byte array `buf`.
- DeserializeElement(buf): Attempt to map input byte array `buf` to an OPRF group element.
  This function can raise a DeserializeError upon failure; see {{OPRF, Section 2.1}}
  for more details.
- Noe: The size of a serialized OPRF group element output from SerializeElement.
- Nok: The size of an OPRF private key as output from DeriveKeyPair.

## Key Derivation Function and Message Authentication Code {#deps-symmetric}

A Key Derivation Function (KDF) is a function that takes some source of initial
keying material and uses it to derive one or more cryptographically strong keys.
This specification uses a KDF with the following API and parameters:

- Extract(salt, ikm): Extract a pseudorandom key of fixed length `Nx` bytes from
  input keying material `ikm` and an optional byte string `salt`.
- Expand(prk, info, L): Expand a pseudorandom key `prk` using optional string `info`
  into `L` bytes of output keying material.
- Nx: The output size of the `Extract()` function in bytes.

This specification also makes use of a collision-resistant Message Authentication Code
(MAC) with the following API and parameters:

- MAC(key, msg): Compute a message authentication code over input `msg` with key
  `key`, producing a fixed-length output of `Nm` bytes.
- Nm: The output size of the `MAC()` function in bytes.

## Hash Functions {#deps-hash}

This specification makes use of a collision-resistant hash function with the following
API and parameters:

- Hash(msg): Apply a cryptographic hash function to input `msg`, producing a
  fixed-length digest of size `Nh` bytes.
- Nh: The output size of the `Hash()` function in bytes.

This specification makes use of a Key Stretching Function (KSF), which is a slow
and expensive cryptographic hash function with the following API:

- Stretch(msg, params): Apply a key stretching function with parameters
  `params` to stretch the input `msg` and harden it against offline
  dictionary attacks. This function also needs to satisfy collision resistance.

# Protocol Overview {#protocol-overview}

OPAQUE consists of two stages: registration and authenticated key exchange.
In the first stage, a client registers its password with the server and stores
its credential file on the server. In the second stage (also called the
"login" stage), the client recovers its authentication material and uses it to
perform a mutually authenticated key exchange.

## Setup

Prior to both stages, the client and server agree on a configuration that
fully specifies the cryptographic algorithm dependencies necessary to run the
protocol; see {{configurations}} for details.
The server chooses a pair of keys (`server_private_key` and `server_public_key`)
for the AKE, and chooses a seed (`oprf_seed`) of `Nh` bytes for the OPRF.
The server can use this single pair of keys with multiple
clients and can opt to use multiple seeds (so long as they are kept consistent for
each client).

## Offline Registration

Registration is the only stage in OPAQUE that requires a server-authenticated
and confidential channel: either physical, out-of-band, PKI-based, etc.

The client inputs its credentials, which includes its password and user
identifier, and the server inputs its parameters, which includes its private key
and other information.

The client output of this stage is a single value `export_key` that the client
may use for application-specific purposes, e.g., to encrypt additional
information for storage on the server. The server does not have access to this
`export_key`.

The server output of this stage is a record corresponding to the client's
registration that it stores in a credential file alongside other client
registrations as needed.

The registration flow is shown below:

~~~
    creds                                   parameters
      |                                         |
      v                                         v
    Client                                    Server
    ------------------------------------------------
                registration request
             ------------------------->
                registration response
             <-------------------------
                      record
             ------------------------->
   ------------------------------------------------
      |                                         |
      v                                         v
  export_key                                 record
~~~

These messages are named `RegistrationRequest`, `RegistrationResponse`, and
`RegistrationRecord`, respectively. Their contents and wire format are defined in
{{registration-messages}}.

## Online Authenticated Key Exchange

In this second stage, a client obtains credentials previously registered
with the server, recovers private key material using the password, and
subsequently uses them as input to the AKE protocol. As in the registration
phase, the client inputs its credentials, including its password and user
identifier, and the server inputs its parameters and the credential file record
corresponding to the client. The client outputs two values, an `export_key`
(matching that from registration) and a `session_key`, the latter of which
is the primary AKE output. The server outputs a single value `session_key`
that matches that of the client. Upon completion, clients and servers can
use these values as needed.

The authenticated key exchange flow is shown below:

~~~
    creds                             (parameters, record)
      |                                         |
      v                                         v
    Client                                    Server
    ------------------------------------------------
                   AKE message 1
             ------------------------->
                   AKE message 2
             <-------------------------
                   AKE message 3
             ------------------------->
   ------------------------------------------------
      |                                         |
      v                                         v
(export_key, session_key)                  session_key
~~~

These messages are named `KE1`, `KE2`, and `KE3`, respectively. They carry the
messages of the concurrent execution of the key recovery process (OPRF) and the
authenticated key exchange (AKE), and their corresponding wire formats are
specified in {{ake-messages}}.

The rest of this document describes the details of these stages in detail.
{{client-material}} describes how client credential information is
generated, encoded, and stored on the server during registration, and recovered during
login. {{offline-phase}} describes the first registration stage of the protocol,
and {{online-phase}} describes the second authentication stage of the protocol.
{{configurations}} describes how to instantiate OPAQUE using different
cryptographic dependencies and parameters.

# Client Credential Storage and Key Recovery {#client-material}

OPAQUE makes use of a structure called `Envelope` to manage client credentials.
The client creates its `Envelope` on registration and sends it to the server for
storage. On every login, the server sends this `Envelope` to the client so it can
recover its key material for use in the AKE.

Future variants of OPAQUE may use different key recovery mechanisms. See {{key-recovery}} for details.

Applications may pin key material to identities if desired. If no identity is given
for a party, its value MUST default to its public key. The following types of
application credential information are considered:

- client_private_key: The encoded client private key for the AKE protocol.
- client_public_key: The encoded client public key for the AKE protocol.
- server_public_key: The encoded server public key for the AKE protocol.
- client_identity: The client identity. This is an application-specific value,
  e.g., an e-mail address or an account name. If not specified, it defaults
  to the client's public key.
- server_identity: The server identity. This is typically a domain name, e.g., example.com.
  If not specified, it defaults to the server's public key. See {{identities}} for
  information about this identity.

These credential values are used in the `CleartextCredentials` structure as follows:

~~~
struct {
  uint8 server_public_key[Npk];
  uint8 server_identity<1..2^16-1>;
  uint8 client_identity<1..2^16-1>;
} CleartextCredentials;
~~~

The function CreateCleartextCredentials constructs a `CleartextCredentials` structure given
application credential information.

~~~
CreateCleartextCredentials

Input:
- server_public_key, the encoded server public key for the AKE protocol.
- client_public_key, the encoded client public key for the AKE protocol.
- server_identity, the optional encoded server identity.
- client_identity, the optional encoded client identity.

Output:
- cleartext_credentials, a CleartextCredentials structure.

def CreateCleartextCredentials(server_public_key, client_public_key,
                               server_identity, client_identity):
  # Set identities as public keys if no application-layer identity is provided
  if server_identity == nil
    server_identity = server_public_key
  if client_identity == nil
    client_identity = client_public_key

  Create CleartextCredentials cleartext_credentials with
    (server_public_key, server_identity, client_identity)
  return cleartext_credentials
~~~

## Key Recovery {#key-recovery}

This specification defines a key recovery mechanism that uses the stretched OPRF
output as a seed to directly derive the private and public key using the
`DeriveAuthKeyPair()` function defined in {{key-creation}}.

### Envelope Structure {#envelope-structure}

The key recovery mechanism defines its `Envelope` as follows:

~~~
struct {
  uint8 nonce[Nn];
  uint8 auth_tag[Nm];
} Envelope;
~~~

nonce: A unique nonce of length `Nn` used to protect this `Envelope`.

auth_tag: An authentication tag protecting the contents of the envelope, covering
the envelope nonce and `CleartextCredentials`.

### Envelope Creation {#envelope-creation}

Clients create an `Envelope` at registration with the function `Store` defined
below.

~~~
Store

Input:
- randomized_pwd, a randomized password.
- server_public_key, the encoded server public key for
  the AKE protocol.
- server_identity, the optional encoded server identity.
- client_identity, the optional encoded client identity.

Output:
- envelope, the client's Envelope structure.
- client_public_key, the client's AKE public key.
- masking_key, an encryption key used by the server with the sole purpose
  of defending against client enumeration attacks.
- export_key, an additional client key.

def Store(randomized_pwd, server_public_key, server_identity, client_identity):
  envelope_nonce = random(Nn)
  masking_key = Expand(randomized_pwd, "MaskingKey", Nh)
  auth_key = Expand(randomized_pwd, concat(envelope_nonce, "AuthKey"), Nh)
  export_key = Expand(randomized_pwd, concat(envelope_nonce, "ExportKey"), Nh)
  seed = Expand(randomized_pwd, concat(envelope_nonce, "PrivateKey"), Nseed)
  (_, client_public_key) = DeriveAuthKeyPair(seed)

  cleartext_creds =
    CreateCleartextCredentials(server_public_key, client_public_key,
                               server_identity, client_identity)
  auth_tag = MAC(auth_key, concat(envelope_nonce, cleartext_creds))

  Create Envelope envelope with (envelope_nonce, auth_tag)
  return (envelope, client_public_key, masking_key, export_key)

def Recover(randomized_pwd, server_public_key, envelope,
            server_identity, client_identity):
  auth_key = Expand(randomized_pwd, concat(envelope.nonce, "AuthKey"), Nh)

  If !ct_equal(envelope.auth_tag, expected_tag)
    raise EnvelopeRecoveryError
  return (client_private_key, export_key)

# Offline Registration {#offline-phase}

The registration process proceeds as follows. The client inputs
the following values:

- password: The client's password.
- creds: The client credentials, as described in {{client-material}}.

The server inputs the following values:

- server_private_key: The server private key for the AKE protocol.
- server_public_key: The server public key for the AKE protocol.
- credential_identifier: A unique identifier for the client's
  credential, generated by the server.
- oprf_seed: A seed used to derive per-client OPRF keys.

The registration protocol then runs as shown below:

~~~
  Client                                         Server
 ------------------------------------------------------
 (request, blind) = CreateRegistrationRequest(password)

                        request
              ------------------------->

 response = CreateRegistrationResponse(request,
                                       server_public_key,
                                       credential_identifier,
                                       oprf_seed)

                        response
              <-------------------------

 (record, export_key) = FinalizeRequest(response,
                                        server_identity,
                                        client_identity)

                        record
              ------------------------->
~~~

{{registration-messages}} describes the formats for the above messages, and
{{registration-functions}} describes details of the functions and the
corresponding parameters referenced above.

Both client and server MUST validate the other party's public key before use.
See {{validation}} for more details. Upon completion, the server stores
the client's credentials for later use. Moreover, the client MAY use the output
`export_key` for further application-specific purposes; see {{export-key-usage}}.

## Registration Messages {#registration-messages}

~~~
struct {
  uint8 blinded_message[Noe];
} RegistrationRequest;

server_public_key: The server's encoded public key that will be used for
the online AKE stage.

~~~
struct {
  uint8 client_public_key[Npk];

## Registration Functions {#registration-functions}

### CreateRegistrationRequest

~~~
CreateRegistrationRequest

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password.

Output:
- request, a RegistrationRequest structure.
- blind, an OPRF scalar value.

def CreateRegistrationRequest(password):
  (blind, blinded_element) = Blind(password)
  blinded_message = SerializeElement(blinded_element)
  Create RegistrationRequest request with blinded_message
  return (request, blind)
~~~

### CreateRegistrationResponse {#create-reg-response}

~~~
CreateRegistrationResponse

Input:
- request, a RegistrationRequest structure.
- server_public_key, the server's public key.
- credential_identifier, an identifier that uniquely represents the credential.
- oprf_seed, the seed of Nh bytes used by the server to generate an oprf_key.

Output:
- response, a RegistrationResponse structure.

Exceptions:
- DeserializeError, when OPRF element deserialization fails.

def CreateRegistrationResponse(request, server_public_key,
                               credential_identifier, oprf_seed):
  seed = Expand(oprf_seed, concat(credential_identifier, "OprfKey"), Nseed)
  (oprf_key, _) = DeriveKeyPair(seed, "OPAQUE-DeriveKeyPair")

  blinded_element = DeserializeElement(request.blinded_message)
  evaluated_element = Evaluate(oprf_key, blinded_element)
  evaluated_message = SerializeElement(evaluated_element)

  Create RegistrationResponse response with (evaluated_message, server_public_key)
  return response
~~~

### FinalizeRequest {#finalize-request}

To create the user record used for further authentication, the client executes
the following function.

~~~
FinalizeRequest

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password.
- blind, an OPRF scalar value.
- response, a RegistrationResponse structure.
- server_identity, the optional encoded server identity.
- client_identity, the optional encoded client identity.

Output:
- record, a RegistrationRecord structure.
- export_key, an additional client key.

Exceptions:
- DeserializeError, when OPRF element deserialization fails.

def FinalizeRequest(password, blind, response, server_identity, client_identity):
  evaluated_element = DeserializeElement(response.evaluated_message)
  oprf_output = Finalize(password, blind, evaluated_element)

  stretched_oprf_output = Stretch(oprf_output, params)
  randomized_pwd = Extract("", concat(oprf_output, stretched_oprf_output))

  (envelope, client_public_key, masking_key, export_key) =
    Store(randomized_pwd, response.server_public_key,
          server_identity, client_identity)
  Create RegistrationRecord record with (client_public_key, masking_key, envelope)
  return (record, export_key)
~~~

See {{online-phase}} for details about the output `export_key` usage.

Upon completion of this function, the client MUST send `record` to the server.

## Finalize Registration {#finalize-registration}

The server stores the `record` object as the credential file for each client
along with the associated `credential_identifier` and `client_identity` (if
different). Note that the values `oprf_seed` and `server_private_key` from the
server's setup phase must also be persisted. The `oprf_seed` value SHOULD be used
for all clients; see {{preventing-client-enumeration}}. The `server_private_key`
may be unique for each client.

# Online Authenticated Key Exchange {#online-phase}

The generic outline of OPAQUE with a 3-message AKE protocol includes three messages:
`KE1`, `KE2`, and `KE3`, where `KE1` and `KE2` include key exchange shares, e.g., DH values, sent
by the client and server, respectively, and `KE3` provides explicit client authentication and
full forward security (without it, forward secrecy is only achieved against eavesdroppers,
which is insufficient for OPAQUE security).

This section describes the online authenticated key exchange protocol flow,
message encoding, and helper functions. This stage is composed of a concurrent
OPRF and key exchange flow. The key exchange protocol is authenticated using the
client and server credentials established during registration; see {{offline-phase}}.
In the end, the client proves its knowledge of the password, and both client and
server agree on (1) a mutually authenticated shared secret key and (2) any optional
application information exchange during the handshake.

In this stage, the client inputs the following values:

- password: The client's password.
- client_identity: The client identity, as described in {{client-material}}.

The server inputs the following values:

- server_private_key: The server's private key for the AKE protocol.
- server_public_key: The server's public key for the AKE protocol.
- server_identity: The server identity, as described in {{client-material}}.
- record: The `RegistrationRecord` object corresponding to the client's registration.
- credential_identifier: An identifier that uniquely represents the credential.
- oprf_seed: The seed used to derive per-client OPRF keys.

The client receives two outputs: a session secret and an export key. The export
key is only available to the client, and may be used for additional
application-specific purposes, as outlined in {{export-key-usage}}. The output
`export_key` MUST NOT be used in any way before the protocol completes
successfully. See {{alternate-key-recovery}} for more details about this
requirement. The server receives a single output: a session secret matching the
client's.

The protocol runs as shown below:

~~~
  Client                                         Server
 ------------------------------------------------------
  ke1 = ClientInit(password)

                         ke1
              ------------------------->

  ke2 = ServerInit(server_identity, server_private_key,
                    server_public_key, record,
                    credential_identifier, oprf_seed, ke1)

                         ke2
              <-------------------------

    (ke3,
    session_key,
    export_key) = ClientFinish(client_identity, password,
                              server_identity, ke2)

                         ke3
              ------------------------->

                       session_key = ServerFinish(ke3)
~~~

Both client and server may use implicit internal state objects to keep necessary
material for the OPRF and AKE, `client_state` and `server_state`, respectively.

The client state may have the following fields:

- password: The client's password.
- blind: The random blinding inverter returned by `Blind()`.
- client_ake_state: The client's AKE state if necessary.

The server state may have the following fields:

- server_ake_state: The server's AKE state if necessary.

The rest of this section describes these authenticated key exchange messages
and their parameters in more detail. {{ake-messages}} defines the structure of the
messages passed between client and server in the above setup. {{ake-functions}}
describes details of the functions and corresponding parameters mentioned above.
{{cred-retrieval}} discusses internal functions used for retrieving client
credentials, and {{ake-protocol}} discusses how these functions are used to execute
the authenticated key exchange protocol.

## AKE Messages {#ake-messages}

In this section, we define the `KE1`, `KE2`, and `KE3` structs which make up
the AKE messages used in the protocol. `KE1` is composed of a `CredentialRequest`
and `AuthRequest`, and `KE2` is composed of a `CredentialResponse`
and `AuthResponse`.

~~~

client_nonce: A fresh randomly generated nonce of length `Nn`.

client_keyshare: A serialized client ephemeral key share of fixed size `Npk`.

~~~
struct {
  CredentialRequest credential_request;
  AuthRequest auth_request;
} KE1;
~~~

  CredentialResponse credential_response;
  AuthResponse auth_response;
} KE2;
~~~

credential_response: A `CredentialResponse` structure.

auth_response: An `AuthResponse` structure.

~~~
struct {
  uint8 client_mac[Nm];
} KE3;
~~~

client_mac: An authentication tag computed over the handshake transcript
of fixed size `Nm`, computed using `Km2`, defined below.

## AKE Functions {#ake-functions}

In this section, we define the main functions used to produce the AKE messages
in the protocol. Note that this section relies on definitions of subroutines defined
in later sections:
- `CreateCredentialRequest`, `CreateCredentialResponse`, `RecoverCredentials`
  defined in {{cred-retrieval}}
- `AuthClientStart`, `AuthServerRespond`, `AuthClientFinalize`, and `AuthServerFinalize`
  defined in {{ake-client}} and {{ake-server}}

### ClientInit

~~~
ClientInit

State:
- state, a ClientState structure.

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password.

Output:
- ke1, a KE1 message structure.

def ClientInit(password):
  request, blind = CreateCredentialRequest(password)
  state.blind = blind
  ake_1 = AuthClientStart(request)
  return KE1(request, ake_1)
~~~

### ServerInit

~~~
ServerInit

Input:
- server_identity, the optional encoded server identity, which is set to
  server_public_key if nil.
- server_private_key, the server's private key.
- server_public_key, the server's public key.
- record, the client's RegistrationRecord structure.
- credential_identifier, an identifier that uniquely represents the credential.
- oprf_seed, the server-side seed of Nh bytes used to generate an oprf_key.
- ke1, a KE1 message structure.
- client_identity, the encoded client identity.

Output:
- ke2, a KE2 structure.

def ServerInit(server_identity, server_private_key, server_public_key,
               record, credential_identifier, oprf_seed, ke1, client_identity):
  response = CreateCredentialResponse(ke1.request, server_public_key, record,
    credential_identifier, oprf_seed)
  ake_2 = AuthServerRespond(server_identity, server_private_key,
    client_identity, record.client_public_key, ke1, response)
  return KE2(response, ake_2)
~~~

### ClientFinish

~~~
ClientFinish

State:
- state, a ClientState structure.

Input:
- client_identity, the optional encoded client identity, which is set
  to client_public_key if not specified.
- server_identity, the optional encoded server identity, which is set
  to server_public_key if not specified.
- ke2, a KE2 message structure.

Output:
- ke3, a KE3 message structure.
- session_key, the session's shared secret.
- export_key, an additional client key.

def ClientFinish(client_identity, server_identity, ke2):
  (client_private_key, server_public_key, export_key) =
    RecoverCredentials(state.password, state.blind, ke2.credential_response,
                       server_identity, client_identity)
  (ke3, session_key) =
    AuthClientFinalize(client_identity, client_private_key, server_identity,
                       server_public_key, ke2)
  return (ke3, session_key, export_key)
~~~

### ServerFinish

Since the OPRF is a two-message protocol, KE3 has no element of the OPRF. We can
therefore call the AKE's `AuthServerFinalize` directly. The `AuthServerFinalize` function
MUST take `KE3` as input and MUST verify the client authentication material it contains
before the `session_key` value can be used. This verification is paramount in order to
ensure forward secrecy against active attackers.

~~~
ServerFinish

State:
- state, a ServerState structure.

Input:
- ke3, a KE3 structure.

Output:
- session_key, the shared session secret if and only if ke3 is valid.

def ServerFinish(ke3):
  return AuthServerFinalize(ke3)
~~~

This function MUST NOT return the `session_key` value if the client authentication
material is invalid, and may instead return an appropriate error message such as
ClientAuthenticationError, invoked from `AuthServerFinalize`.

## Credential Retrieval {#cred-retrieval}

### Credential Retrieval Messages

~~~
struct {
  uint8 blinded_message[Noe];
} CredentialRequest;
~~~

blinded_message: A serialized OPRF group element.

~~~
struct {
  uint8 evaluated_message[Noe];
  uint8 masking_nonce[Nn];
  uint8 masked_response[Npk + Ne];
} CredentialResponse;
~~~

evaluated_message: A serialized OPRF group element.

masking_nonce: A nonce used for the confidentiality of the
`masked_response` field.

masked_response: An encrypted form of the server's public key and the
client's `Envelope` structure.

### Credential Retrieval Functions

#### CreateCredentialRequest {#create-credential-request}

~~~
CreateCredentialRequest

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password.

Output:
- request, a CredentialRequest structure.
- blind, an OPRF scalar value.

def CreateCredentialRequest(password):
  (blind, blinded_element) = Blind(password)
  blinded_message = SerializeElement(blinded_element)
  Create CredentialRequest request with blinded_message
  return (request, blind)
~~~

#### CreateCredentialResponse {#create-credential-response}

There are two scenarios to handle for the construction of a CredentialResponse
object: either the record for the client exists (corresponding to a properly
registered client), or it was never created (corresponding to a client that has
yet to register).

In the case of an existing record with the corresponding identifier
`credential_identifier`, the server invokes the following function to
produce a CredentialResponse:

~~~
CreateCredentialResponse

Input:
- request, a CredentialRequest structure.
- server_public_key, the public key of the server.
- record, an instance of RegistrationRecord which is the server's
  output from registration.
- credential_identifier, an identifier that uniquely represents the credential.
- oprf_seed, the server-side seed of Nh bytes used to generate an oprf_key.

Output:
- response, a CredentialResponse structure.

Exceptions:
- DeserializeError, when OPRF element deserialization fails.

def CreateCredentialResponse(request, server_public_key, record,
                             credential_identifier, oprf_seed):
  seed = Expand(oprf_seed, concat(credential_identifier, "OprfKey"), Nok)
  (oprf_key, _) = DeriveKeyPair(seed, "OPAQUE-DeriveKeyPair")

  blinded_element = DeserializeElement(request.blinded_message)
  evaluated_element = Evaluate(oprf_key, blinded_element)
  evaluated_message = SerializeElement(evaluated_element)

  masking_nonce = random(Nn)
  credential_response_pad = Expand(record.masking_key,
                                   concat(masking_nonce, "CredentialResponsePad"),
                                   Npk + Ne)
  masked_response = xor(credential_response_pad,
                        concat(server_public_key, record.envelope))
  Create CredentialResponse response with (evaluated_message, masking_nonce, masked_response)
  return response
~~~

In the case of a record that does not exist and if client enumeration prevention is desired,
the server MUST respond to the credential request to fake the existence of the record.
The server SHOULD invoke the `CreateCredentialResponse` function with a fake client record
argument that is configured so that:

- `record.client_public_key` is set to a randomly generated public key of length `Npk`
- `record.masking_key` is set to a random byte string of length `Nh`
- `record.envelope` is set to the byte string consisting only of zeros of length `Ne`

It is RECOMMENDED that a fake client record is created once (e.g. as the first user record
of the application) and stored alongside legitimate client records. This allows servers to locate
the record in time comparable to that of a legitimate client record.

Note that the responses output by either scenario are indistinguishable to an adversary
that is unable to guess the registered password for the client corresponding to `credential_identifier`.

#### RecoverCredentials {#recover-credentials}

~~~
RecoverCredentials

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password.
- blind, an OPRF scalar value.
- response, a CredentialResponse structure.
- server_identity, The optional encoded server identity.
- client_identity, The encoded client identity.

Output:
- client_private_key, the client's private key for the AKE protocol.
- server_public_key, the public key of the server.
- export_key, an additional client key.

Exceptions:
- DeserializeError, when OPRF element deserialization fails.

def RecoverCredentials(password, blind, response,
                       server_identity, client_identity):
  evaluated_element = DeserializeElement(response.evaluated_message)

  oprf_output = Finalize(password, blind, evaluated_element)
  stretched_oprf_output = Stretch(oprf_output, params)
  randomized_pwd = Extract("", concat(oprf_output, stretched_oprf_output))

  masking_key = Expand(randomized_pwd, "MaskingKey", Nh)
  credential_response_pad = Expand(masking_key,
                                   concat(response.masking_nonce, "CredentialResponsePad"),
                                   Npk + Ne)
  concat(server_public_key, envelope) = xor(credential_response_pad,
                                              response.masked_response)
  (client_private_key, export_key) =
    Recover(randomized_pwd, server_public_key, envelope,
            server_identity, client_identity)

  return (client_private_key, server_public_key, export_key)
~~~

## AKE Protocol {#ake-protocol}

This section describes the authenticated key exchange protocol for OPAQUE using
3DH, a 3-message AKE which satisfies the forward secrecy and KCI properties
discussed in {{security-considerations}}.

The AKE client state `client_ake_state` mentioned in {{online-phase}} has the
following fields:

- client_secret: An opaque byte string of length `Nsk`.
- ke1: a value of type `KE1`.

The server state `server_ake_state` mentioned in {{online-phase}} has the
following fields:

- expected_client_mac: An opaque byte string of length `Nm`.
- session_key: An opaque byte string of length `Nx`.

{{ake-client}} and {{ake-server}} specify the inner workings of client and
server functions, respectively.

### Key Creation {#key-creation}

We assume the following functions to exist for all candidate groups in this
setting:

- DeriveAuthKeyPair(seed): Derive a private and public authentication key pair
  deterministically from the input `seed`. This function is implemented as
  DeriveKeyPair(seed, "OPAQUE-DeriveAuthKeyPair"), where DeriveKeyPair is
  as specified in {{OPRF, Section 3.2}}.
- GenerateAuthKeyPair(): Return a randomly generated private and public key
  pair. This can be implemented by invoking DeriveAuthKeyPair with `Nseed`
  random bytes as input.
- SerializeElement(element): A member function of the underlying group that
  maps `element` to a unique byte array, mirrored from the definition of the
  similarly-named function of the OPRF group described in
  {{OPRF, Section 2.1}}.

### Key Schedule Functions

#### Transcript Functions {#transcript-functions}

The OPAQUE-3DH key derivation procedures make use of the functions below,
re-purposed from TLS 1.3 {{?RFC8446}}.

~~~
Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Context, Length) =
    Expand(Secret, CustomLabel, Length)
~~~

Where CustomLabel is specified as:

~~~
struct {
  uint16 length = Length;
  opaque label<8..255> = "OPAQUE-" + Label;
  uint8 context<0..255> = Context;
} CustomLabel;

Derive-Secret(Secret, Label, Transcript-Hash) =
    Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Transcript-Hash, Nx)
~~~

Note that the `Label` parameter is not a NULL-terminated string.

OPAQUE-3DH can optionally include shared `context` information in the
transcript, such as configuration parameters or application-specific info, e.g.
"appXYZ-v1.2.3".

The OPAQUE-3DH key schedule requires a preamble, which is computed as follows.

~~~
Preamble

Parameters:
- context, optional shared context information.

Input:
- client_identity, the optional encoded client identity, which is set
  to client_public_key if not specified.
- ke1, a KE1 message structure.
- server_identity, the optional encoded server identity, which is set
  to server_public_key if not specified.
- ke2, a KE2 message structure.

Output:
- preamble, the protocol transcript with identities and messages.

def Preamble(client_identity, ke1, server_identity, ke2):
  preamble = concat("RFCXXXX",
                     I2OSP(len(context), 2), context,
                     I2OSP(len(client_identity), 2), client_identity,
                     ke1,
                     I2OSP(len(server_identity), 2), server_identity,
                     ke2.credential_response,
                     ke2.auth_response.server_nonce,
                     ke2.auth_response.server_keyshare)
  return preamble
~~~

#### Shared Secret Derivation

The OPAQUE-3DH shared secret derived during the key exchange protocol is
computed using the following helper function.

~~~
DeriveKeys

Input:
- ikm, input key material.
- preamble, the protocol transcript with identities and messages.

Output:
- Km2, a MAC authentication key.
- Km3, a MAC authentication key.
- session_key, the shared session secret.

def DeriveKeys(ikm, preamble):
  prk = Extract("", ikm)
  handshake_secret = Derive-Secret(prk, "HandshakeSecret", Hash(preamble))
  session_key = Derive-Secret(prk, "SessionKey", Hash(preamble))
  Km2 = Derive-Secret(handshake_secret, "ServerMAC", "")
  Km3 = Derive-Secret(handshake_secret, "ClientMAC", "")
  return (Km2, Km3, session_key)
~~~

# Configurations {#configurations}

An OPAQUE-3DH configuration is a tuple (OPRF, KDF, MAC, Hash, KSF, Group, Context)
such that the following conditions are met:

- The OPRF protocol uses the "base mode" variant of {{OPRF}} and implements
  the interface in {{dependencies}}. Examples include OPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512) and
  OPRF(P-256, SHA-256).
- The KDF, MAC, and Hash functions implement the interfaces in {{dependencies}}.
  Examples include HKDF {{RFC5869}} for the KDF, HMAC {{!RFC2104}} for the MAC,
  and SHA-256 and SHA-512 for the Hash functions. If an extensible output function
  such as SHAKE128 {{FIPS202}} is used then the output length `Nh` MUST be chosen
  to align with the target security level of the OPAQUE configuration. For example,
  if the target security parameter for the configuration is 128-bits, then `Nh` SHOULD be at least 32 bytes.
- The KSF has fixed parameters, chosen by the application, and implements the
  interface in {{dependencies}}. Examples include Argon2 {{?ARGON2=RFC9106}},
  scrypt {{?SCRYPT=RFC7914}}, and PBKDF2 {{?PBKDF2=RFC2898}} with fixed parameter choices.
- The Group mode identifies the group used in the OPAQUE-3DH AKE. This SHOULD
  match that of the OPRF. For example, if the OPRF is OPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512),
  then Group SHOULD be ristretto255.

Context is the shared parameter used to construct the preamble in {{transcript-functions}}.
This parameter SHOULD include any application-specific configuration information or
parameters that are needed to prevent cross-protocol or downgrade attacks.

Absent an application-specific profile, the following configurations are RECOMMENDED:

- OPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512), HKDF-SHA-512, HMAC-SHA-512, SHA-512, Scrypt(32768,8,1), internal, ristretto255
- OPRF(P-256, SHA-256), HKDF-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-256, SHA-256, Scrypt(32768,8,1), internal, P-256

Future configurations may specify different combinations of dependent algorithms,
with the following considerations:

1. The size of AKE public and private keys -- `Npk` and `Nsk`, respectively -- must adhere
to the output length limitations of the KDF Expand function. If HKDF is used, this means
Npk, Nsk <= 255 * Nx, where Nx is the output size of the underlying hash function.
See {{RFC5869}} for details.
2. The output size of the Hash function SHOULD be long enough to produce a key for
MAC of suitable length. For example, if MAC is HMAC-SHA256, then `Nh` could be
32 bytes.

# Application Considerations {#app-considerations}

Beyond choosing an appropriate configuration, there are several parameters which
applications can use to control OPAQUE:

- Credential identifier: As described in {{offline-phase}}, this is a unique
  handle to the client's credential being stored. In applications where there are alternate
  client identities that accompany an account, such as a username or email address, this
  identifier can be set to those alternate values. For simplicity, applications may choose
  to set `credential_identifier` to be equal to `client_identity`. Applications
  MUST NOT use the same credential identifier for multiple clients.
- Context information: As described in {{configurations}}, applications may include
  a shared context string that is authenticated as part of the handshake. This parameter
  SHOULD include any configuration information or parameters that are needed to prevent
  cross-protocol or downgrade attacks. This context information is not sent over the
  wire in any key exchange messages. However, applications may choose to send it alongside
  key exchange messages if needed for their use case.
- Client and server identities: As described in {{client-material}}, clients
  and servers are identified with their public keys by default. However, applications
  may choose alternate identities that are pinned to these public keys. For example,
  servers may use a domain name instead of a public key as their identifier. Absent
  alternate notions of an identity, applications SHOULD set these identities to nil
  and rely solely on public key information.
- Enumeration prevention: As described in {{create-credential-response}}, if servers
  receive a credential request for a non-existent client, they SHOULD respond with a
  "fake" response in order to prevent active client enumeration attacks. Servers that
  implement this mitigation SHOULD use the same configuration information (such as
  the oprf_seed) for all clients; see {{preventing-client-enumeration}}. In settings
  where this attack is not a concern, servers may choose to not support this functionality.

# Implementation Considerations {#implementation-considerations}

This section documents considerations for OPAQUE implementations. This includes
implementation safeguards and error handling considerations.

## Implementation Safeguards

Certain information created, exchanged, and processed in OPAQUE is sensitive.
Specifically, all private key material and intermediate values, along with the
outputs of the key exchange phase, are all secret. Implementations should not
retain these values in memory when no longer needed. Moreover, all operations,
particularly the cryptographic and group arithmetic operations, should be
constant-time and independent of the bits of any secrets. This includes any
conditional branching during the creation of the credential response, as needed
to mitigate against client enumeration attacks.

As specified in {{offline-phase}} and {{online-phase}}, OPAQUE only requires
the client password as input to the OPRF for registration and authentication.
However, implementations can incorporate the client identity alongside the
password as input to the OPRF. This provides additional client-side entropy
which can supplement the entropy that should be introduced by the server during
an honest execution of the protocol. This also provides domain separation
between different clients that might otherwise share the same password.

Finally, note that online guessing attacks (against any aPAKE) can be done from
both the client side and the server side. In particular, a malicious server can
attempt to simulate honest responses in order to learn the client's password.
Implementations and deployments of OPAQUE SHOULD consider additional checks to
mitigate this type of attack: for instance, by ensuring that there is a
server-authenticated channel over which OPAQUE registration and login is run.

## Error Considerations

Some functions included in this specification are fallible. For example, the
authenticated key exchange protocol may fail because the client's password was
incorrect or the authentication check failed, yielding an error. The explicit
errors generated throughout this specifiation, along with conditions that lead
to each error, are as follows:

- EnvelopeRecoveryError: The envelope Recover function failed to produce any
  authentication key material; {{envelope-recovery}}.
- ServerAuthenticationError: The client failed to complete the authenticated
  key exchange protocol with the server; {{ake-client}}.
- ClientAuthenticationError: The server failed to complete the authenticated
  key exchange protocol with the client; {{ake-server}}.

Beyond these explicit errors, OPAQUE implementations can produce implicit errors.
For example, if protocol messages sent between client and server do not match
their expected size, an implementaton should produce an error. More generally,
if any protocol message received from the peer is invalid, perhaps because the
message contains an invalid public key (indicated by the AKE DeserializeElement
function failing) or an invalid OPRF element (indicated by the OPRF DeserializeElement),
then an implementation should produce an error.

The errors in this document are meant as a guide for implementors. They are not an
exhaustive list of all the errors an implementation might emit. For example, an
implementation might run out of memory.

<!--
TODO(caw): As part of https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque/issues/312, address
the failure case that occurs when Blind fails, noting that this is an exceptional case that
happens with negligible probability

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

OPAQUE is defined as the composition of two functionalities: an OPRF and
an AKE protocol. It can be seen as a "compiler" for transforming any AKE
protocol (with KCI security and forward secrecy; see below)
into a secure aPAKE protocol. In OPAQUE, the client stores a secret private key at the
server during password registration and retrieves this key each time
it needs to authenticate to the server. The OPRF security properties
ensure that only the correct password can unlock the private key
while at the same time avoiding potential offline guessing attacks.
This general composability property provides great flexibility and
enables a variety of OPAQUE instantiations, from optimized
performance to integration with existing authenticated key exchange
protocols such as TLS.

## Notable Design Differences

[[RFC EDITOR: Please delete this section before publication.]]

The specification as written here differs from the original cryptographic design in {{JKX18}}
and the corresponding CFRG document {{I-D.krawczyk-cfrg-opaque-03}}, both of which were used
as input to the CFRG PAKE competition. This section describes these differences, including
their motivation and explanation as to why they preserve the provable security of OPAQUE based
on {{JKX18}}.

The following list enumerates important functional differences that were made
as part of the protocol specification process to address application or
implementation considerations.

- Clients construct envelope contents without revealing the password to the
  server, as described in {{offline-phase}}, whereas the servers construct
  envelopes in {{JKX18}}. This change adds to the security of the protocol.
  {{JKX18}} considered the case where the envelope was constructed by the
  server for reasons of compatibility with previous UC modeling. An upcoming
  paper analyzes the registration phase as specified in this document. This
  change was made to support registration flows where the client chooses the
  password and wishes to keep it secret from the server, and it is compatible
  with the variant in {{JKX18}} that was originally analyzed.
- Envelopes do not contain encrypted credentials. Instead, envelopes contain
  information used to derive client private key material for the AKE. This
  variant is also analyzed in the new paper referred to in the previous item.
  This change improves the assumption behind the protocol by getting rid of
  equivocability and random key robustness for the encryption function. The
  latter property is only required for authentication and achieved by a
  collision-resistant MAC. This change was made for two reasons. First, it
  reduces the number of bytes stored in envelopes, which is an helpful
  improvement for large applications of OPAQUE with many registered users.
  Second, it removes the need for client applications to generate authentication
  keys during registration. Instead, this responsibility is handled by OPAQUE,
  thereby simplifying the client interface to the protocol.
- Envelopes are masked with a per-user masking key as a way of preventing
  client enumeration attacks. See {{preventing-client-enumeration}} for more
  details. This extension is not needed for the security of OPAQUE as an aPAKE
  but only used to provide a defense against enumeration attacks. In the
  analysis, the masking key can be simulated as a (pseudo) random key. This
  change was made to support real-world use cases where client or user
  enumeration is a security (or privacy) risk.
- Per-user OPRF keys are derived from a client identity and cross-user PRF seed
  as a mitigation against client enumeration attacks. See
  {{preventing-client-enumeration}} for more details. The analysis of OPAQUE
  assumes OPRF keys of different users are independently random or
  pseudorandom. Deriving these keys via a single PRF (i.e., with a single
  cross-user key) applied to users' identities satisfies this assumption.
  This change was made to support real-world use cases where client or user
  enumeration is a security (or privacy) risk.
- The protocol outputs an export key for the client in addition to shared
  session key that can be used for application-specific purposes. This key
  is a pseudorandom value independent of other values in the protocol and
  has no influence in the security analysis (it can be simulated with a
  random output). This change was made to support more application use cases
  for OPAQUE, such as use of OPAQUE for end-to-end encrypted backups;
  see {{WhatsAppE2E}}.
- The protocol admits optional application-layer client and server identities.
  In the absence of these identities, client and server are authenticated
  against their public keys. Binding authentication to identities is part
  of the AKE part of OPAQUE. The type of identities and their semantics
  are application dependent and independent of the protocol analysis. This
  change was made to simplify client and server interfaces to the protocol
  by removing the need to specify additional identities alongside their
  corresponding public authentication keys when not needed.
- The protocol admits application-specific context information configured
  out-of-band in the AKE transcript. This allows domain separation between
  different application uses of OPAQUE. This is a mechanism for the AKE
  component and is best practice as for domain separation between different
  applications of the protocol. This change was made to allow different
  applications to use OPAQUE without risk of cross-protocol attacks.
- Servers use a separate identifier for computing OPRF evaluations and
  indexing into the password file storage, called the credential_identifier.
  This allows clients to change their application-layer identity
  (client_identity) without inducing server-side changes, e.g., by changing
  an email address associated with a given account. This mechanism is part
  of the derivation of OPRF keys via a single PRF. As long as the derivation
  of different OPRF keys from a single OPRF have different PRF inputs, the
  protocol is secure. The choice of such inputs is up to the application.

The following list enumerates notable differences and refinements from the original
cryptographic design in {{JKX18}} and the corresponding CFRG document
{{I-D.krawczyk-cfrg-opaque-03}} that were made to make this specification
suitable for interoperable implementations.

- {{JKX18}} used a generic prime-order group for the DH-OPRF and HMQV operations,
  and includes necessary prime-order subgroup checks when receiving attacker-controlled
  values over the wire. This specification instantiates the prime-order group using for
  3DH using prime-order groups based on elliptic curves, as described in
  {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf, Section 2.1}}. This specification also delegates OPRF group
  choice and operations to {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}. As such, the prime-order group as used
  in the OPRF and 3DH as specified in this document both adhere to the requirements as
  {{JKX18}}.
- {{JKX18}} specified DH-OPRF (see Appendix B) to instantiate
  the OPRF functionality in the protocol. A critical part of DH-OPRF is the
  hash-to-group operation, which was not instantiated in the original analysis.
  However, the requirements for this operation were included. This specification
  instantiates the OPRF functionality based on the {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}, which
  is identical to the DH-OPRF functionality in {{JKX18}} and, concretely, uses
  the hash-to-curve functions in {{?I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}}. All hash-to-curve
  methods in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve}} are compliant with the requirement
  in {{JKX18}}, namely, that the output be a member of the prime-order group.
- {{JKX18}} and {{I-D.krawczyk-cfrg-opaque-03}} both used HMQV as the AKE
  for the protocol. However, this document fully specifies 3DH instead of HMQV
  (though a sketch for how to instantiate OPAQUE using HMQV is included in {{hmqv-sketch}}).
  Since 3DH satisfies the essential requirements for the AKE as described in {{JKX18}}
  and {{I-D.krawczyk-cfrg-opaque-03}}, as recalled in {{security-analysis}}, this change
  preserves the overall security of the protocol. 3DH was chosen for its
  simplicity and ease of implementation.
- The DH-OPRF and HMQV instantiation of OPAQUE in {{JKX18}}, Figure 12 uses
  a different transcript than that which is described in this specification. In particular,
  the key exchange transcript specified in {{ake-protocol}} is a superset of the transcript
  as defined in {{JKX18}}. This was done to align with best practices, such as is
  done for key exchange protocols like TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}}.
- Neither {{JKX18}} nor {{I-D.krawczyk-cfrg-opaque-03}} included wire format details for the
  protocol, which is essential for interoperability. This specification fills this
  gap by including such wire format details and corresponding test vectors; see {{test-vectors}}.

## Security Analysis {#security-analysis}

Jarecki et al. {{JKX18}} proved the security of OPAQUE
in a strong aPAKE model that ensures security against pre-computation attacks
and is formulated in the Universal Composability (UC) framework {{Canetti01}}
under the random oracle model. This assumes security of the OPRF
function and the underlying key exchange protocol. In turn, the
security of the OPRF protocol from {{OPRF}} is proven
in the random oracle model under the One-More Diffie-Hellman assumption {{JKKX16}}.

OPAQUE's design builds on a line of work initiated in the seminal
paper of Ford and Kaliski {{FK00}} and is based on the HPAKE protocol
of Xavier Boyen {{Boyen09}} and the (1,1)-PPSS protocol from Jarecki
et al. {{JKKX16}}. None of these papers considered security against
pre-computation attacks or presented a proof of aPAKE security
(not even in a weak model).

The KCI property required from AKE protocols for use with OPAQUE
states that knowledge of a party's private key does not allow an attacker
to impersonate others to that party. This is an important security
property achieved by most public-key based AKE protocols, including
protocols that use signatures or public key encryption for
authentication. It is also a property of many implicitly
authenticated protocols, e.g., HMQV, but not all of them. We also note that
key exchange protocols based on shared keys do not satisfy the KCI
requirement, hence they are not considered in the OPAQUE setting.
We note that KCI is needed to ensure a crucial property of OPAQUE: even upon
compromise of the server, the attacker cannot impersonate the client to the
server without first running an exhaustive dictionary attack.
Another essential requirement from AKE protocols for use in OPAQUE is to
provide forward secrecy (against active attackers).

## Related Protocols

Despite the existence of multiple designs for (PKI-free) aPAKE protocols,
none of these protocols are secure against pre-computation attacks.
This includes protocols that have recent analyses in the UC model such
as AuCPace {{AuCPace}} and SPAKE2+ {{SPAKE2plus}}. In particular, none
of these protocols can use the standard technique against pre-computation
that combines secret random values ("salt") into the one-way password mappings.
Either these protocols do not use a salt at all or, if they do, they
transmit the salt from server to client in the clear, hence losing the
secrecy of the salt and its defense against pre-computation.

We note that as shown in {{JKX18}}, these protocols, and any aPAKE
in the model from {{GMR06}}, can be converted into an aPAKE secure against
pre-computation attacks at the expense of an additional OPRF execution.

Beyond AuCPace and SPAKE2+, the most widely deployed PKI-free aPAKE is SRP {{?RFC2945}},
which is vulnerable to pre-computation attacks, lacks proof of security, and is
less efficient than OPAQUE. Moreover, SRP requires a ring as it mixes addition and
multiplication operations, and thus does not work over standard elliptic curves.
OPAQUE is therefore a suitable replacement for applications that use SRP.

## Identities {#identities}

AKE protocols generate keys that need to be uniquely and verifiably bound to a pair
of identities. In the case of OPAQUE, those identities correspond to client_identity and server_identity.
Thus, it is essential for the parties to agree on such identities, including an
agreed bit representation of these identities as needed.

Applications may have different policies about how and when identities are
determined. A natural approach is to tie client_identity to the identity the server uses
to fetch envelope (hence determined during password registration) and to tie server_identity
to the server identity used by the client to initiate an offline password
registration or online authenticated key exchange session. server_identity and client_identity can also
be part of the envelope or be tied to the parties' public keys. In principle, identities
may change across different sessions as long as there is a policy that
can establish if the identity is acceptable or not to the peer. However, we note
that the public keys of both the server and the client must always be those defined
at the time of password registration.

The client identity (client_identity) and server identity (server_identity) are
optional parameters that are left to the application to designate as aliases for
the client and server. If the application layer does not supply values for these
parameters, then they will be omitted from the creation of the envelope
during the registration stage. Furthermore, they will be substituted with
client_identity = client_public_key and server_identity = server_public_key during
the authenticated key exchange stage.

The advantage to supplying a custom client_identity and server_identity (instead of simply relying
on a fallback to client_public_key and server_public_key) is that the client can then ensure that any
mappings between client_identity and client_public_key (and server_identity and server_public_key)
are protected by the authentication from the envelope. Then, the client can verify that the
client_identity and server_identity contained in its envelope match the client_identity
and server_identity supplied by the server.

However, if this extra layer of verification is unnecessary for the application, then simply
leaving client_identity and server_identity unspecified (and using client_public_key and
server_public_key instead) is acceptable.

## Export Key Usage {#export-key-usage}

The export key can be used (separately from the OPAQUE protocol) to provide
confidentiality and integrity to other data which only the client should be
able to process. For instance, if the server is expected to maintain any
client-side secrets which require a password to access, then this export key
can be used to encrypt these secrets so that they remain hidden from the
server.

## Static Diffie-Hellman Oracles

While one can expect the practical security of the OPRF function (namely,
the hardness of computing the function without knowing the key) to be in the
order of computing discrete logarithms or solving Diffie-Hellman, Brown and
Gallant {{BG04}} and Cheon {{Cheon06}} show an attack that slightly improves
on generic attacks. For typical curves, the attack requires an infeasible
number of calls to the OPRF or results in insignificant security loss;
see {{OPRF}} for more information. For OPAQUE, these attacks
are particularly impractical as they translate into an infeasible number of
failed authentication attempts directed at individual users.

## Input Validation {#validation}

Both client and server MUST validate the other party's public key(s) used
for the execution of OPAQUE. This includes the keys shared during the
offline registration phase, as well as any keys shared during the online
key agreement phase. The validation procedure varies depending on the
type of key. For example, for OPAQUE instantiations
using 3DH with P-256, P-384, or P-521 as the underlying group, validation
is as specified in Section 5.6.2.3.4 of {{keyagreement}}. This includes
checking that the coordinates are in the correct range, that the point
is on the curve, and that the point is not the point at infinity.
Additionally, validation MUST ensure the Diffie-Hellman shared secret is
not the point at infinity.

## OPRF Key Stretching

Applying a key streching function to the output of the OPRF greatly increases the cost of an offline
attack upon the compromise of the credential file at the server. Applications
SHOULD select parameters that balance cost and complexity. Note that in
OPAQUE, the key stretching function is executed by the client, as opposed to
the server. This means that applications must consider a tradeoff between the
performance of the protocol on clients (specifically low-end devices) and
protection against offline attacks after a server compromise.

## Client Enumeration {#preventing-client-enumeration}

Client enumeration refers to attacks where the attacker tries to learn
extra information about the behavior of clients that have registered with
the server. There are two types of attacks we consider:

1) An attacker tries to learn whether a given client identity is registered
with a server, and
2) An attacker tries to learn whether a given client identity has recently
completed registration, re-registered (e.g. after a password change), or
changed its identity.

OPAQUE prevents these attacks during the authentication flow. The first is
prevented by requiring servers to act with unregistered client identities in a
way that is indistinguishable from its behavior with existing registered clients.
Servers do this by simulating a fake CredentialResponse as specified in
{{create-credential-response}} for unregistered users, and also encrypting both
CredentialResponse using a masking key. In this way, real and fake CredentialResponse
messages are indistinguishable from one another.
Implementations must also take care to avoid side-channel leakage (e.g., timing
attacks) from helping differentiate these operations from a regular server
response. Note that this may introduce possible abuse vectors since the
server's cost of generating a CredentialResponse is less than that of the
client's cost of generating a CredentialRequest. Server implementations
may choose to forego the construction of a simulated credential response
message for an unregistered client if these client enumeration attacks can
be mitigated through other application-specific means or are otherwise not
applicable for their threat model.

Preventing the second type of attack requires the server to supply a
credential_identifier value for a given client identity, consistently between
the registration response and credential response; see {{create-reg-response}}
and {{create-credential-response}}. Note that credential_identifier can be set
to client_identity for simplicity.

In the event of a server compromise that results in a re-registration of
credentials for all compromised clients, the oprf_seed value MUST be resampled,
resulting in a change in the oprf_key value for each client. Although this
change can be detected by an adversary, it is only leaked upon password rotation
after the exposure of the credential files, and equally affects all registered
clients.

Finally, applications must use the same key recovery mechanism when using this
prevention throughout their lifecycle. The envelope size may vary between
mechanisms, so a switch could then be detected.

OPAQUE does not prevent either type of attack during the registration flow.
Servers necessarily react differently during the registration flow between
registered and unregistered clients. This allows an attacker to use the server's
response during registration as an oracle for whether a given client identity is
registered. Applications should mitigate against this type of attack by rate
limiting or otherwise restricting the registration flow.

## Password Salt and Storage Implications

In OPAQUE, the OPRF key acts as the secret salt value that ensures the infeasibility
of pre-computation attacks. No extra salt value is needed. Also, clients never
disclose their passwords to the server, even during registration. Note that a corrupted
server can run an exhaustive offline dictionary attack to validate guesses for the client's
password; this is inevitable in any aPAKE protocol. (OPAQUE enables defense against such
offline dictionary attacks by distributing the server so that an offline attack is only
possible if all - or a minimal number of - servers are compromised {{JKX18}}.) Furthermore,
if the server does not sample this OPRF key with sufficiently high entropy, or if it is not
kept hidden from an adversary, then any derivatives from the client's password may also be
susceptible to an offline dictionary attack to recover the original password.

Some applications may require learning the client's password for enforcing password
rules. Doing so invalidates this important security property of OPAQUE and is
NOT RECOMMENDED. Applications should move such checks to the client. Note that
limited checks at the server are possible to implement, e.g., detecting repeated
passwords.

## AKE Private Key Storage

Server implementations of OPAQUE do not need access to the raw AKE private key. They only require
the ability to compute shared secrets as specified in {{key-schedule-functions}}. Thus, applications
may store the server AKE private key in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or
similar. Upon compromise of the OPRF seed and client envelopes, this would prevent an
attacker from using this data to mount a server spoofing attack. Supporting implementations
need to consider allowing separate AKE and OPRF algorithms in cases where the HSM is
incompatible with the OPRF algorithm.

# Alternate Key Recovery Mechanisms {#alternate-key-recovery}

Client authentication material can be stored and retrieved using different key
recovery mechanisms. Any key recovery mechanism that encrypts data
in the envelope MUST use an authenticated encryption scheme with random
key-robustness (or key-committing). Deviating from the key-robustness
requirement may open the protocol to attacks, e.g., {{LGR20}}.
This specification enforces this property by using a MAC over the envelope
contents.

We remark that export_key for authentication or encryption requires
no special properties from the authentication or encryption schemes
as long as export_key is used only after authentication material is successfully
recovered, i.e., after the MAC in RecoverCredentials passes verification.

# Alternate AKE Instantiations {#alternate-akes}

It is possible to instantiate OPAQUE with other AKEs, such as HMQV {{HMQV}} and SIGMA-I.
HMQV is similar to 3DH but varies in its key schedule. SIGMA-I uses digital signatures
rather than static DH keys for authentication. Specification of these instantiations is
left to future documents. A sketch of how these instantiations might change is included
in the next subsection for posterity.

OPAQUE may also be instantiated with any post-quantum (PQ) AKE protocol that has the message
flow above and security properties (KCI resistance and forward secrecy) outlined
in {{security-considerations}}. Note that such an instantiation is not quantum-safe unless
the OPRF is quantum-safe. However, an OPAQUE instantiation where the AKE is quantum-safe,
but the OPRF is not, would still ensure the confidentiality of application data encrypted
under session_key (or a key derived from it) with a quantum-safe encryption function.

## HMQV Instantiation Sketch {#hmqv-sketch}

An HMQV instantiation would work similar to OPAQUE-3DH, differing primarily in the key
schedule {{HMQV}}. First, the key schedule `preamble` value would use a different constant prefix
-- "HMQV" instead of "3DH" -- as shown below.

~~~
preamble = concat("HMQV",
                  I2OSP(len(client_identity), 2), client_identity,
                  KE1,
                  I2OSP(len(server_identity), 2), server_identity,
                  KE2.credential_response,
                  KE2.auth_response.server_nonce,
                  KE2.auth_response.server_keyshare)
~~~

Second, the IKM derivation would change. Assuming HMQV is instantiated with a cyclic
group of prime order p with bit length L, clients would compute `IKM` as follows:

~~~
u' = (eskU + u \* skU) mod p
IKM = (epkS \* pkS^s)^u'
~~~

Likewise, servers would compute `IKM` as follows:

~~~
s' = (eskS + s \* skS) mod p
IKM = (epkU \* pkU^u)^s'
~~~

In both cases, `u` would be computed as follows:

~~~
hashInput = concat(I2OSP(len(epkU), 2), epkU,
                   I2OSP(len(info), 2), info,
                   I2OSP(len("client"), 2), "client")
u = Hash(hashInput) mod L
~~~

Likewise, `s` would be computed as follows:

~~~
hashInput = concat(I2OSP(len(epkS), 2), epkS,
                   I2OSP(len(info), 2), info,
                   I2OSP(len("server"), 2), "server")
s = Hash(hashInput) mod L
~~~

Hash is the same hash function used in the main OPAQUE protocol for key derivation.
Its output length (in bits) must be at least L.

## SIGMA-I Instantiation Sketch

A SIGMA-I instantiation differs more drastically from OPAQUE-3DH since authentication
uses digital signatures instead of Diffie Hellman. In particular, both KE2 and KE3
would carry a digital signature, computed using the server and client private keys
established during registration, respectively, as well as a MAC, where the MAC is
computed as in OPAQUE-3DH.

The key schedule would also change. Specifically, the key schedule `preamble` value would
use a different constant prefix -- "SIGMA-I" instead of "3DH" -- and the `IKM` computation
would use only the ephemeral key shares exchanged between client and server.

# Test Vectors {#test-vectors}

This section contains real and fake test vectors for the OPAQUE-3DH specification.
Each real test vector in {{real-vectors}} specifies the configuration information,
protocol inputs, intermediate values computed during registration and authentication,
and protocol outputs.

Similarly, each fake test vector in {{fake-vectors}} specifies
the configuration information, protocol inputs, and protocol
outputs computed during authentication of an unknown or unregistered user. Note that `masking_key`, `client_private_key`, and
`client_public_key` are used as additional inputs as described in
{{create-credential-response}}. `client_public_key` is used as the fake record's public key, and
`masking_key` for the fake record's masking key parameter.

All values are encoded in hexadecimal strings. The configuration information
includes the (OPRF, Hash, KSF, KDF, MAC, Group, Context) tuple, where the Group
matches that which is used in the OPRF. These test vectors were generated using
draft-09 of {{OPRF}}.
