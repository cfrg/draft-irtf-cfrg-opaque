--- abstract

This document describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric
password-authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual
authentication in a client-server setting without reliance on PKI and
with security against pre-computation attacks upon server compromise.
In addition, the protocol provides forward secrecy and the ability to
hide the password from the server, even during password registration.
This document specifies the core OPAQUE protocol and one instantiation
based on 3DH.

# Introduction {#intro}

Password authentication is ubiquitous in many applications. In a common
implementation, a client authenticates to a server by sending its client
ID and password to the server over a secure connection. This makes
the password vulnerable to server mishandling, including accidentally
logging the password or storing it in plaintext in a database. Server
compromise resulting in access to these plaintext passwords is not an
uncommon security incident, even among security-conscious organizations.
Moreover, plaintext password authentication over secure channels such as
TLS is also vulnerable to cases where TLS may fail, including PKI
attacks, certificate mishandling, termination outside the security
perimeter, visibility to TLS-terminating intermediaries, and more.

Asymmetric (or Augmented) Password Authenticated Key Exchange (aPAKE)
protocols are designed to provide password authentication and
mutually authenticated key exchange in a client-server setting without
relying on PKI (except during client registration) and without
disclosing passwords to servers or other entities other than the client
machine. A secure aPAKE should provide the best possible security for a
password protocol. Indeed, some attacks are inevitable, such as
online impersonation attempts with guessed client passwords and offline
dictionary attacks upon the compromise of a server and leakage of its
credential file. In the latter case, the attacker learns a mapping of
a client's password under a one-way function and uses such a mapping to
validate potential guesses for the password. Crucially important is
for the password protocol to use an unpredictable one-way mapping.
Otherwise, the attacker can pre-compute a deterministic list of mapped
passwords leading to almost instantaneous leakage of passwords upon
server compromise.

This document describes OPAQUE, a PKI-free secure aPAKE that is secure
against pre-computation attacks. OPAQUE provides forward secrecy with
respect to password leakage while also hiding the password from the
server, even during password registration. OPAQUE allows applications
to increase the difficulty of offline dictionary attacks via iterated
hashing or other hardening schemes. OPAQUE is also extensible, allowing
clients to safely store and retrieve arbitrary application data on servers
using only their password.

OPAQUE is defined and proven as the composition of three functionalities:
an oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF), a key recovery mechanism,
and an authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol. It can be seen
as a "compiler" for transforming any suitable AKE protocol into a secure
aPAKE protocol. (See {{security-considerations}} for requirements of the
OPRF and AKE protocols.) This document specifies one OPAQUE instantiation
based on 3DH {{SIGNAL}}. Other instantiations are possible, as discussed in
{{alternate-akes}}, but their details are out of scope for this document.
In general, the modularity of OPAQUE's design makes it easy to integrate
with additional AKE protocols, e.g., TLS or HMQV, and with future ones such
as those based on post-quantum techniques.

OPAQUE consists of two stages: registration and authenticated key exchange.
In the first stage, a client registers its password with the server and stores
information used to recover authentication credentials on the server. Recovering these
credentials can only be done with knowledge of the client password. In the second
stage, a client uses its password to recover those credentials and subsequently
uses them as input to an AKE protocol.

This draft complies with the requirements for PAKE protocols set forth in
{{RFC8125}}.

## Requirements Notation

{::boilerplate bcp14}

## Notation {#notation}

The following functions are used throughout this document:

- I2OSP and OS2IP: Convert a byte string to and from a non-negative integer as
  described in Section 4 of {{?RFC8017}}. Note that these functions operate on
  byte strings in big-endian byte order.
- concat(x0, ..., xN): Concatenate byte strings. For example,
  `concat(0x01, 0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506`.
- random(n): Generate a cryptographically secure pseudorandom byte string of length `n` bytes.
- xor(a,b): Apply XOR to byte strings. For example, `xor(0xF0F0, 0x1234) = 0xE2C4`.
  It is an error to call this function with arguments of unequal length.
- ct_equal(a, b): Return `true` if `a` is equal to `b`, and false otherwise.
  The implementation of this function must be constant-time in the length of `a`
  and `b`, which are assumed to be of equal length, irrespective of the values `a`
  or `b`.

Except if said otherwise, random choices in this specification refer to
drawing with uniform distribution from a given set (i.e., "random" is short
for "uniformly random"). Random choices can be replaced with fresh outputs from
a cryptographically strong pseudorandom generator, according to the requirements
in {{!RFC4086}}, or pseudorandom function. For convenience, we define `nil` as a
lack of value.

All protocol messages and structures defined in this document use the syntax from
{{?RFC8446, Section 3}}.

The name OPAQUE is a homonym of O-PAKE where O is for Oblivious. The name
OPAKE was taken.

# Cryptographic Dependencies {#dependencies}

OPAQUE depends on the following cryptographic protocols and primitives:

- Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF); {{deps-oprf}}
- Key Derivation Function (KDF); {{deps-symmetric}}
- Message Authenticate Code (MAC); {{deps-symmetric}}
- Cryptographic Hash Function; {{deps-hash}}
- Memory-Hard Function (MHF); {{deps-hash}}
- Key Recovery Mechanism; {{deps-keyrec}}
- Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol; {{deps-ake}}

This section describes these protocols and primitives in more detail. Unless said
otherwise, all random nonces used in these dependencies and the rest of the OPAQUE
protocol are of length `Nn` = 32 bytes.

## Oblivious Pseudorandom Function {#deps-oprf}

An Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) is a two-party protocol between client and
server for computing a PRF such that the client learns the PRF output and neither party learns
the input of the other. This specification uses the the OPRF defined in {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}},
Version -07, with the following API and parameters:

- Blind(x): Convert input `x` into an element of the OPRF group, randomize it
  by some scalar `r`, producing `M`, and output (`r`, `M`).
- Evaluate(k, M): Evaluate input element `M` using private key `k`, yielding
  output element `Z`.
- Finalize(x, r, Z): Finalize the OPRF evaluation using input `x`,
  random scalar `r`, and evaluation output `Z`, yielding output `y`.
- DeriveKeyPair(seed): Derive a private and public key pair deterministically
  from a seed.
- Noe: The size of a serialized OPRF group element.
- Nok: The size of an OPRF private key.

Note that we only need the base mode variant (as opposed to the verifiable mode
variant) of the OPRF described in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}. The implementation of
DeriveKeyPair based on {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}} is below:

~~~
DeriveKeyPair(seed)

Input:
- seed, pseudo-random byte sequence used as a seed.

Output:
- private_key, a private key.
- public_key, the associated public key.

Steps:
1. private_key = HashToScalar(seed, dst="OPAQUE-DeriveKeyPair")
2. public_key = ScalarBaseMult(private_key)
3. Output (private_key, public_key)
~~~

HashToScalar(msg, dst) is as specified in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf, Section 2.1}}.

## Key Derivation Function and Message Authentication Code {#deps-symmetric}

A Key Derivation Function (KDF) is a function that takes some source of initial
keying material and uses it to derive one or more cryptographically strong keys.
This specification uses a KDF with the following API and parameters:

- Extract(salt, ikm): Extract a pseudorandom key of fixed length `Nx` bytes from
  input keying material `ikm` and an optional byte string `salt`.
- Expand(prk, info, L): Expand a pseudorandom key `prk` using optional string `info`
  into `L` bytes of output keying material.
- Nx: The output size of the `Extract()` function in bytes.

This specification also makes use of a Message Authentication Code (MAC) with
the following API and parameters:

- MAC(key, msg): Compute a message authentication code over input `msg` with key
  `key`, producing a fixed-length output of `Nm` bytes.
- Nm: The output size of the `MAC()` function in bytes.

## Hash Functions {#deps-hash}

This specification makes use of a collision-resistant hash function with the following
API and parameters:

- Hash(msg): Apply a cryptographic hash function to input `msg`, producing a
  fixed-length digest of size `Nh` bytes.
- Nh: The output size of the `Hash()` function in bytes.

A Memory Hard Function (MHF) is a slow and expensive cryptographic hash function
with the following API:

- Harden(msg, params): Repeatedly apply a memory-hard function with parameters
  `params` to strengthen the input `msg` against offline dictionary attacks.
  This function also needs to satisfy collision resistance.

## Key Recovery Method {#deps-keyrec}

OPAQUE relies on a key recovery mechanism for storing authentication
material on the server and recovering it on the client. This material
is encapsulated in an envelope, whose structure, encoding,
and size must be specified by the key recovery mechanism. The size of
the envelope is denoted `Ne` and may vary between mechanisms.

The key recovery storage mechanism takes as input a private seed and outputs
an envelope. The retrieval process takes as input a private seed and envelope
and outputs authentication material. The signatures for these functionalities
are as follows:

- Store(private_seed): build and return an `Envelope` structure and the client's
public key.
- Recover(private_seed, envelope): recover and return the authentication
material for the AKE from the Envelope. This function raises an error if the
private seed cannot be used for recovering authentication material from the
input envelope.

The key recovery mechanism MUST return an error when trying to recover
authentication material from an envelope with a private seed that was not used
in producing the envelope.

Moreover, it MUST be compatible with the chosen AKE. For example, the key
recovery mechanism specified in {{key-recovery}} directly recovers a private key
from a seed, and the cryptographic primitive in the AKE must therefore support
such a possibility.

If applications implement {{preventing-client-enumeration}}, they MUST use the
same mechanism throughout their lifecycle in order to avoid activity leaks due
to switching.

## Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) Protocol {#deps-ake}

OPAQUE additionally depends on a three-message Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE)
protocol which satisfies the forward secrecy and KCI properties discussed in
{{security-considerations}}.

This specification defines one particular AKE based on 3DH; see {{ake-protocol}}.
3DH assumes a prime-order group as described in
{{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf, Section 2.1}}. We let `Npk` and `Nsk` denote the size of
public and private keys, respectively, used in the AKE.

# Protocol Overview {#protocol-overview}

OPAQUE consists of two stages: registration and authenticated key exchange.
In the first stage, a client registers its password with the server and stores
its credential file on the server. In the second stage the client recovers its
authentication material and uses it to perform a mutually authenticated key
exchange.

## Registration

Registration is the only part in OPAQUE that requires a server-authenticated
and confidential channel, either physical, out-of-band, PKI-based, etc.

The client inputs its credentials, which includes its password and user
identifier, and the server inputs its parameters, which includes its private key
and other information.

The client output of this stage is a single value `export_key` that the client
may use for application-specific purposes, e.g., to encrypt additional
information for storage on the server. The server does not have access to this
`export_key`.

The server output of this stage is a record corresponding to the client's
registration that it stores in a credential file alongside other client
registrations as needed.

The registration flow is shown below:

~~~
    creds                                   parameters
      |                                         |
      v                                         v
    Client                                    Server
    ------------------------------------------------
                registration request
             ------------------------->
                registration response
             <-------------------------
                      record
             ------------------------->
   ------------------------------------------------
      |                                         |
      v                                         v
  export_key                                 record
~~~

These messages are named `RegistrationRequest`, `RegistrationResponse`, and
`Record`, respectively. Their contents and wire format are defined in
{{registration-messages}}.

## Online Authentication

In this second stage, a client obtains credentials previously registered
with the server, recovers private key material using the password, and
subsequently uses them as input to the AKE protocol. As in the registration
phase, the client inputs its credentials, including its password and user
identifier, and the server inputs its parameters and the credential file record
corresponding to the client. The client outputs two values, an `export_key`
(matching that from registration) and a `session_key`, the latter of which
is the primary AKE output. The server outputs a single value `session_key`
that matches that of the client. Upon completion, clients and servers can
use these values as needed.

The authenticated key exchange flow is shown below:

~~~
    creds                             (parameters, record)
      |                                         |
      v                                         v
    Client                                    Server
    ------------------------------------------------
                   AKE message 1
             ------------------------->
                   AKE message 2
             <-------------------------
                   AKE message 3
             ------------------------->
   ------------------------------------------------
      |                                         |
      v                                         v
(export_key, session_key)                  session_key
~~~

These messages are named `KE1`, `KE2`, and `KE3`, respectively. They carry the
messages of the concurrent execution of the key recovery process (OPRF) and the
authenticated key exchange (AKE):

- `KE1` is composed of the `CredentialRequest` and `AKE_Init` messages
- `KE2` is composed of the `CredentialResponse` and `AKE_Response` messages
- `KE3` represents the `AKE_Finalize` message

The `CredentialRequest` and `CredentialResponse` message contents and wire
format are specified in {{cred-retrieval}}, and those of `AKE_Init`,
`AKE_Response` and `AKE_Finalize` are specified in {{ake-messages}}.

## Protocol State {#protocol-state}

Both client and server may use implicit internal state objects to keep necessary
material for the OPRF and AKE, `client_state` and `server_state`, respectively.

The client state may have the following named fields:

- blind, the random blinding scalar returned by `Blind()`, of length Nok; and
- client_ake_state, the client's AKE state if necessary.

The server state may have the following fields:

- server_ake_state, the server's AKE state if necessary.

The rest of this document describes the details of these stages in detail.
{{client-material}} describes how client credential information is
generated, encoded, stored on the server on registration, and recovered on
login. {{offline-phase}} describes the first registration stage of the protocol,
and {{online-phase}} describes the second authentication stage of the protocol.
{{configurations}} describes how to instantiate OPAQUE using different
cryptographic dependencies and parameters.

# Client Credential Storage and Key Recovery {#client-material}

OPAQUE makes use of a structure called `Envelope` to manage client credentials.
The client creates its `Envelope` on registration and sends it to the server for
storage. On every login, the server sends this `Envelope` to the client so it can
recover its key material for use in the AKE.

Future variants of OPAQUE may use different key recovery mechanisms. See {{key-recovery}} for details.

Applications may pin key material to identities if desired. If no identity is given
for a party, its value MUST default to its public key. The following types of
application credential information are considered:

- client_private_key: The encoded client private key for the AKE protocol.
- client_public_key: The encoded client public key for the AKE protocol.
- server_public_key: The encoded server public key for the AKE protocol.
- client_identity: The client identity. This is an application-specific value,
  e.g., an e-mail address or an account name. If not specified, it defaults
  to the client's public key.
- server_identity: The server identity. This is typically a domain name, e.g., example.com.
  If not specified, it defaults to the server's public key. See {{identities}} for
  information about this identity.

These credential values are used in the `CleartextCredentials` structure as follows:

~~~
struct {
  uint8 server_public_key[Npk];
  uint8 server_identity<1..2^16-1>;
  uint8 client_identity<1..2^16-1>;
} CleartextCredentials;
~~~

The function CreateCleartextCredentials constructs a `CleartextCredentials` structure given
application credential information.

~~~
CreateCleartextCredentials(server_public_key, client_public_key,
                           server_identity, client_identity)

Input:
- server_public_key, The encoded server public key for the AKE protocol.
- client_public_key, The encoded client public key for the AKE protocol.
- server_identity, The optional encoded server identity.
- client_identity, The optional encoded client identity.

Output:
- cleartext_credentials, a CleartextCredentials structure

Steps:
1. if server_identity == nil
2.    server_identity = server_public_key
3. if client_identity == nil
4.    client_identity = client_public_key
5. Create CleartextCredentials cleartext_credentials
   with (server_public_key, server_identity, client_identity)
6. Output cleartext_credentials
~~~

## Key Recovery {#key-recovery}

This specification defines a key recovery mechanism that uses the hardened OPRF
output as a seed to directly derive the private and public key using the
`DeriveAuthKeyPair()` function defined in {{key-creation}}.

### Envelope Structure {#envelope-structure}

The key recovery mechanism defines its `Envelope` as follows:

~~~
struct {
  uint8 nonce[Nn];
  uint8 auth_tag[Nm];
} Envelope;
~~~

nonce: A unique nonce of length `Nn` used to protect this Envelope.

auth_tag: Authentication tag protecting the contents of the envelope, covering
the envelope nonce, and `CleartextCredentials`.

### Envelope Creation {#envelope-creation}

Clients create an `Envelope` at registration with the function `Store` defined
below.

~~~
Store(randomized_pwd, server_public_key, server_identity, client_identity)

Input:
- randomized_pwd, randomized password.
- server_public_key, The encoded server public key for
  the AKE protocol.
- server_identity, The optional encoded server identity.
- client_identity, The optional encoded client identity.

Output:
- envelope, the client's `Envelope` structure.
- client_public_key, the client's AKE public key.
- masking_key, a key used by the server to encrypt the
  envelope during login.
- export_key, an additional client key.

Steps:
1. envelope_nonce = random(Nn)
2. masking_key = Expand(randomized_pwd, "MaskingKey", Nh)
3. auth_key = Expand(randomized_pwd, concat(envelope_nonce, "AuthKey"), Nh)
4. export_key = Expand(randomized_pwd, concat(envelope_nonce, "ExportKey"), Nh)

6. _, client_public_key = DeriveAuthKeyPair(seed)
7. cleartext_creds = CreateCleartextCredentials(server_public_key, client_public_key, server_identity, client_identity)
8. auth_tag = MAC(auth_key, concat(envelope_nonce, cleartext_creds))

     raise KeyRecoveryError
8. Output (client_private_key, export_key)
~~~

# Offline Registration {#offline-phase}

This section describes the registration flow, message encoding, and helper functions.
In a setup phase, the client chooses its password, and the server chooses its own pair
of private-public AKE keys (server_private_key, server_public_key) for use with the
AKE, along with a Nh-byte oprf_seed. The server can use the same pair of keys with multiple
clients and can opt to use multiple seeds (so long as they are kept consistent for
each client). These steps can happen offline, i.e., before the registration phase.

Once complete, the registration process proceeds as follows. The client inputs
the following values:

- password: client password.
- creds: client credentials, as described in {{client-material}}.

The server inputs the following values:

- server_private_key: server private key for the AKE protocol.
- server_public_key: server public key for the AKE protocol.
- credential_identifier: unique identifier for the client's
  credential, generated by the server.
- oprf_seed: seed used to derive per-client OPRF keys.

The registration protocol then runs as shown below:

~~~
  Client                                         Server
 ------------------------------------------------------
 (request, blind) = CreateRegistrationRequest(password)

                        request
              ------------------------->

 response = CreateRegistrationResponse(request,
                                       server_public_key,
                                       credential_identifier,
                                       oprf_seed)

                        response
              <-------------------------

 (record, export_key) = FinalizeRequest(client_private_key,
                                        password,
                                        blind,
                                        response,
                                        server_identity,
                                        client_identity)

                        record
              ------------------------->
~~~

{{registration-functions}} describes details of the functions and the
corresponding parameters referenced above.

Both client and server MUST validate the other party's public key before use.
See {{validation}} for more details. Upon completion, the server stores
the client's credentials for later use. Moreover, the client MAY use the output
`export_key` for further application-specific purposes; see {{export-key-usage}}.

## Registration Messages {#registration-messages}

~~~
struct {
  uint8 data[Noe];
} RegistrationRequest;

## Registration Functions {#registration-functions}

### CreateRegistrationRequest

~~~
CreateRegistrationRequest(password)

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password.

Output:
- request, a RegistrationRequest structure.
- blind, an OPRF scalar value.

Steps:
1. (blind, M) = Blind(password)
2. Create RegistrationRequest request with M
3. Output (request, blind)
~~~

3. Z = Evaluate(oprf_key, request.data)
4. Create RegistrationResponse response with (Z, server_public_key)
5. Output response
~~~

### FinalizeRequest {#finalize-request}

To create the user record used for further authentication, the client executes
the following function.

~~~
FinalizeRequest(password, blind, response, server_identity, client_identity)

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password.
- blind, the OPRF scalar value used for blinding.
- response, a RegistrationResponse structure.
- server_identity, the optional encoded server identity.
- client_identity, the optional encoded client identity.

Output:
- record, a RegistrationRecord structure.

2. randomized_pwd = Extract("", Harden(y, params))
3. (envelope, client_public_key, masking_key, export_key) =
    Store(randomized_pwd, response.server_public_key,
                    server_identity, client_identity)
4. Create RegistrationUpload record with (client_public_key, masking_key, envelope)
5. Output (record, export_key)
~~~

See {{online-phase}} for details about the output export_key usage.

Upon completion of this function, the client MUST send `record` to the server.

## Finalize Registration {#finalize-registration}

The server stores the `record` object as the credential file for each client
along with the associated `credential_identifier` and `client_identity` (if
different). Note that the values `oprf_seed` and `server_private_key` from the
server's setup phase must also be persisted. The `oprf_seed` value SHOULD be used
for all clients; see {{preventing-client-enumeration}}. The `server_private_key`
may be unique for each client.

# Online Authenticated Key Exchange {#online-phase}

The generic outline of OPAQUE with a 3-message AKE protocol includes three messages
ke1, ke2, and ke3, where ke1 and ke2 include key exchange shares, e.g., DH values, sent
by the client and server, respectively, and ke3 provides explicit client authentication and
full forward security (without it, forward secrecy is only achieved against eavesdroppers,
which is insufficient for OPAQUE security).

This section describes the online authenticated key exchange protocol flow,
message encoding, and helper functions. This stage is composed of a concurrent
OPRF and key exchange flow. The key exchange protocol is authenticated using the
client and server credentials established during registration; see {{offline-phase}}.
In the end, the client proves its knowledge of the password, and both client and
server agree on (1) a mutually authenticated shared secret key and (2) any optional
application information exchange during the handshake.

In this stage, the client inputs the following values:

- password: client password.
- client_identity: client identity, as described in {{client-material}}.

The server inputs the following values:

- server_private_key: server private for the AKE protocol.
- server_public_key: server public for the AKE protocol.
- server_identity: server identity, as described in {{client-material}}.
- record: RegistrationUpload corresponding to the client's registration.
- credential_identifier: an identifier that uniquely represents the credential.
- oprf_seed: seed used to derive per-client OPRF keys.

The client receives two outputs: a session secret and an export key. The export
key is only available to the client, and may be used for additional
application-specific purposes, as outlined in {{export-key-usage}}. The output
`export_key` MUST NOT be used in any way before the protocol completes
successfully. See {{alternate-key-recovery}} for more details about this
requirement. The server receives a single output: a session secret matching the
client's.

The protocol runs as shown below:

~~~
  Client                                         Server
 ------------------------------------------------------
  ke1 = ClientInit(password)

                         ke1
              ------------------------->

  ke2 = ServerInit(server_identity, server_private_key,
                    server_public_key, record,
                    credential_identifier, oprf_seed, ke1)

                         ke2
              <-------------------------

    (ke3,
    session_key,
    export_key) = ClientFinish(client_identity, password,
                              server_identity, ke2)

                         ke3
              ------------------------->

                       session_key = ServerFinish(ke3)
~~~

The rest of this section describes these authenticated key exchange messages
and their parameters in more detail. {{cred-retrieval}} discusses internal
functions used for retrieving client credentials, and {{ake-protocol}} discusses
how these functions are used to execute the authenticated key exchange protocol.

## Credential Retrieval {#cred-retrieval}

### Credential Retrieval Messages

~~~
struct {
  uint8 data[Noe];
} CredentialRequest;
~~~

data
: A serialized OPRF group element.

~~~
struct {
  uint8 data[Noe];
  uint8 masking_nonce[Nn];
  uint8 masked_response[Npk + Ne];
} CredentialResponse;
~~~

data
: A serialized OPRF group element.

masking_nonce
: A nonce used for the confidentiality of the masked_response field.

masked_response
: An encrypted form of the server's public key and the client's `Envelope`
structure.

### Credential Retrieval Functions

#### CreateCredentialRequest {#create-credential-request}

~~~
CreateCredentialRequest(password)

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password.

Output:
- request, a CredentialRequest structure.
- blind, an OPRF scalar value.

Steps:
1. (blind, M) = Blind(password)
2. Create CredentialRequest request with M
3. Output (request, blind)
~~~

#### CreateCredentialResponse {#create-credential-response}

There are two scenarios to handle for the construction of a CredentialResponse
object: either the record for the client exists (corresponding to a properly
registered client), or it was never created (corresponding to a client that has
yet to register).

In the case of an existing record with the corresponding identifier
`credential_identifier`, the server invokes the following function to
produce a CredentialResponse:

~~~
CreateCredentialResponse(request, server_public_key, record,
                         credential_identifier, oprf_seed)

Input:
- request, a CredentialRequest structure.
- server_public_key, the public key of the server.
- record, an instance of RegistrationRecord which is the server's
  output from registration.
- credential_identifier, an identifier that uniquely represents the credential.
- oprf_seed, the server-side seed of Nh bytes used to generate an oprf_key.

Output:
- response, a CredentialResponse structure.

Steps:
1. seed = Expand(oprf_seed, concat(credential_identifier, "OprfKey"), Nok)
2. (oprf_key, _) = DeriveKeyPair(seed)
3. Z = Evaluate(oprf_key, request.data)
4. masking_nonce = random(Nn)
5. credential_response_pad = Expand(record.masking_key,
     concat(masking_nonce, "CredentialResponsePad"), Npk + Ne)
6. masked_response = xor(credential_response_pad,
                         concat(server_public_key, record.envelope))
7. Create CredentialResponse response with (Z, masking_nonce, masked_response)
8. Output response
~~~

In the case of a record that does not exist and if client enumeration prevention is desired,
the server MUST respond to the credential request to fake the existence of the record.
The server SHOULD invoke the CreateCredentialResponse function with a fake client record
argument that is configured so that:

- record.client_public_key is set to a randomly generated public key of length Npk
- record.masking_key is set to a random byte string of length Nh
- record.envelope is set to the byte string consisting only of zeros of length Ne

It is RECOMMENDED that a fake client record is created once (e.g. as the first user record
of the application) and stored alongside legitimate client records. This allows servers to locate
the record in time comparable to that of a legitimate client record.

Note that the responses output by either scenario are indistinguishable to an adversary
that is unable to guess the registered password for the client corresponding to credential_identifier.

#### RecoverCredentials {#recover-credentials}

~~~
RecoverCredentials(password, blind, response,
                   server_identity, client_identity)

Input:
- password, an opaque byte string containing the client's password.
- blind, an OPRF scalar value.
- response, a CredentialResponse structure.
- server_identity, The optional encoded server identity.
- client_identity, The optional encoded client identity.

Output:
- client_private_key, the client's private key for the AKE protocol.
- server_public_key, the public key of the server.
- export_key, an additional client key.

Steps:
1. y = Finalize(password, blind, response.data)
2. randomized_pwd = Extract("", Harden(y, params))
3. masking_key = Expand(randomized_pwd, "MaskingKey", Nh)
4. credential_response_pad = Expand(masking_key,
     concat(response.masking_nonce, "CredentialResponsePad"), Npk + Ne)
5. concat(server_public_key, envelope) = xor(credential_response_pad,
                                              response.masked_response)
6. (client_private_key, export_key) =
    Recover(randomized_pwd, server_public_key, envelope,
                    server_identity, client_identity)
7. Output (client_private_key, server_public_key, export_key)
~~~

## AKE Protocol {#ake-protocol}

This section describes the authenticated key exchange protocol for OPAQUE using 3DH,
a 3-message AKE which satisfies the forward secrecy and KCI properties discussed in
{{security-considerations}}. The protocol consists of three messages sent between
client and server, each computed using the following application APIs:

- ke1 = ClientInit(password)
- ke2 = ServerInit(server_identity, server_private_key, server_public_key, record, credential_identifier, oprf_seed, ke1)
- ke3, session_key, export_key = ClientFinish(password, client_identity, server_identity, ke2)
- session_key = ServerFinish(ke3)

Outputs `ke1`, `ke2`, and `ke3` are the three protocol messages sent between client
and server. `session_key` and `export_key` are outputs to be consumed by applications.
Applications can use `session_key` to derive additional keying material as needed.
Applications can use `export_key` for further application-specific purposes;
see {{export-key-usage}}.

Both ClientFinish and ServerFinish return an error if authentication failed. In this case,
clients and servers MUST NOT use any outputs from the protocol, such as `session_key` or
`export_key`. ClientInit and ServerInit both implicitly return internal state objects
`client_state` and `server_state`, respectively. The client state has the following
named fields:

- blind, an opaque byte string of length Nok;
- client_sescret, an opaque byte string of length Nsk; and
- ke1, a value of type KE1.

The server state has the following fields:

- expected_client_mac, an opaque byte string of length Nm; and
- session_key, an opaque byte string of length Nx.

{{ake-client}} and {{ake-server}} specify the inner workings of client and
server functions, respectively.s

Prior to the execution of these functions, both the client and the server MUST agree
on a configuration; see {{configurations}} for details.

### AKE Messages {#ake-messages}

~~~
struct {
  uint8 client_nonce[Nn];
  uint8 client_keyshare[Npk];
} AKE_Init;
~~~

client_nonce : A fresh randomly generated nonce of length Nn.

client_keyshare : Client ephemeral key share of fixed size Npk.

~~~
struct {
  uint8 server_nonce[Nn];
  uint8 server_keyshare[Npk];
  uint8 server_mac[Nm];
} AKE_Response;
~~~

server_nonce : A fresh randomly generated nonce of length Nn.

server_keyshare : Server ephemeral key share of fixed size Npk, where Npk
depends on the corresponding prime order group.

server_mac : An authentication tag computed over the handshake transcript
computed using Km2, defined below.

~~~
struct {
  uint8 client_mac[Nm];
} AKE_Finalize;
~~~

client_mac : An authentication tag computed over the handshake transcript
computed using Km2, defined below.

### Key Creation {#key-creation}

We assume the following functions to exist for all candidate groups in this
setting:

- RecoverPublicKey(private_key): Recover the public key related to the input
`private_key`.
- DeriveAuthKeyPair(seed): Derive a private and public authentication key pair
  deterministically from the input `seed`.
- GenerateAuthKeyPair(): Return a randomly generated private and public key
pair. This can be implemented by generating a random private key `sk`, then
computing `pk = RecoverPublicKey(sk)`.

The implementation of DeriveAuthKeyPair is as follows:

~~~
DeriveAuthKeyPair(seed)

Input:
- seed, pseudo-random byte sequence used as a seed.

Output:
- private_key, a private key.
- public_key, the associated public key.

Steps:
1. private_key = HashToScalar(seed, dst="OPAQUE-HashToScalar")
2. public_key = ScalarBaseMult(private_key)
3. Output (private_key, public_key)
~~~

HashToScalar(msg, dst) is as specified in {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf, Section 2.1}}.

### Key Schedule Functions

#### Transcript Functions {#transcript-functions}

The OPAQUE-3DH key derivation procedures make use of the functions below,
re-purposed from TLS 1.3 {{?RFC8446}}.

~~~
Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Context, Length) =
    Expand(Secret, CustomLabel, Length)
~~~

Where CustomLabel is specified as:

~~~
struct {
  uint16 length = Length;
  opaque label<8..255> = "OPAQUE-" + Label;
  uint8 context<0..255> = Context;
} CustomLabel;

Derive-Secret(Secret, Label, Transcript-Hash) =
    Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Transcript-Hash, Nx)
~~~

Note that the Label parameter is not a NULL-terminated string.

OPAQUE-3DH can optionally include shared `context` information in the
transcript, such as configuration parameters or application-specific info, e.g.
"appXYZ-v1.2.3".

The OPAQUE-3DH key schedule requires a preamble, which is computed as follows.

~~~
Preamble(client_identity, ke1, server_identity, inner_ke2)

Parameters:
- context, optional shared context information.

Input:
- client_identity, the optional encoded client identity, which is set
  to client_public_key if not specified.
- ke1, a KE1 message structure.

                     ke1,
                     I2OSP(len(server_identity), 2), server_identity,
                     inner_ke2)
2. Output preamble
~~~

#### Shared Secret Derivation

The OPAQUE-3DH shared secret derived during the key exchange protocol is computed
using the following function.

~~~
TripleDHIKM(sk1, pk1, sk2, pk2, sk3, pk3)

Input:
- skx, scalar to be multiplied with their corresponding pkx.
- pkx, element to be multiplied with their corresponding skx.

Output:
- ikm, input key material.

Steps:
1. dh1 = SerializePublicKey(sk1 * pk1)
2. dh2 = SerializePublicKey(sk2 * pk2)
3. dh3 = SerializePublicKey(sk3 * pk3)
4. Output concat(dh1, dh2, dh3)
~~~

Using this shared secret, further keys used for encryption and authentication are
computed using the following function.

~~~

# Configurations {#configurations}

An OPAQUE-3DH configuration is a tuple (OPRF, KDF, MAC, Hash, MHF, Group, Context)
such that the following conditions are met:

- The OPRF protocol uses the "base mode" variant of {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}} and implements
  the interface in {{dependencies}}. Examples include OPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512) and
  OPRF(P-256, SHA-256).
- The KDF, MAC, and Hash functions implement the interfaces in {{dependencies}}.
  Examples include HKDF {{RFC5869}} for the KDF, HMAC {{!RFC2104}} for the MAC,
  and SHA-256 and SHA-512 for the Hash functions. If an extensible output function
  such as SHAKE128 {{FIPS202}} is used then the output length `Nh` MUST be chosen
  to align with the target security level of the OPAQUE configuration. For example,
  if the target security parameter for the configuration is 128-bits, then `Nh` SHOULD be at least 32 bytes.
- The MHF has fixed parameters, chosen by the application, and implements the
  interface in {{dependencies}}. Examples include Argon2 {{?I-D.irtf-cfrg-argon2}},
  scrypt {{?RFC7914}}, and PBKDF2 {{?RFC2898}} with fixed parameter choices.
- The Group mode identifies the group used in the OPAQUE-3DH AKE. This SHOULD
  match that of the OPRF. For example, if the OPRF is OPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512),
  then Group SHOULD be ristretto255.

Context is the shared parameter used to construct the preamble in {{transcript-functions}}.
This parameter SHOULD include any application-specific configuration information or
parameters that are needed to prevent cross-protocol or downgrade attacks.

Absent an application-specific profile, the following configurations are RECOMMENDED:

- OPRF(ristretto255, SHA-512), HKDF-SHA-512, HMAC-SHA-512, SHA-512, Scrypt(32768,8,1), internal, ristretto255
- OPRF(P-256, SHA-256), HKDF-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-256, SHA-256, Scrypt(32768,8,1), internal, P-256

Future configurations may specify different combinations of dependent algorithms,
with the following considerations:

1. The size of AKE public and private keys -- `Npk` and `Nsk`, respectively -- must adhere
to the output length limitations of the KDF Expand function. If HKDF is used, this means
Npk, Nsk <= 255 * Nx, where Nx is the output size of the underlying hash function.
See {{RFC5869}} for details.
1. The output size of the Hash function SHOULD be long enough to produce a key for
MAC of suitable length. For example, if MAC is HMAC-SHA256, then `Nh` could be
32 bytes.

# Application Considerations {#app-considerations}

Beyond choosing an appropriate configuration, there are several parameters which
applications can use to control OPAQUE:

- Credential identifier: As described in {{offline-phase}}, this is a unique
  handle to the client's credential being stored. In applications where there are alternate
  client identities that accompany an account, such as a username or email address, this
  identifier can be set to those alternate values. For simplicity, applications may choose
  to set `credential_identifier` to be equal to `client_identity`. Applications
  MUST NOT use the same credential identifier for multiple clients.
- Context information: As described in {{configurations}}, applications may include
  a shared context string that is authenticated as part of the handshake. This parameter
  SHOULD include any configuration information or parameters that are needed to prevent
  cross-protocol or downgrade attacks. This context information is not sent over the
  wire in any key exchange messages. However, applications may choose to send it alongside
  key exchange messages if needed for their use case.
- Client and server identities: As described in {{client-material}}, clients
  and servers are identified with their public keys by default. However, applications
  may choose alternate identities that are pinned to these public keys. For example,
  servers may use a domain name instead of a public key as their identifier. Absent
  alternate notions of an identity, applications SHOULD set these identities to nil
  and rely solely on public key information.
- Enumeration prevention: As described in {{create-credential-response}}, if servers
  receive a credential request for a non-existent client, they SHOULD respond with a
  "fake" response in order to prevent active client enumeration attacks. Servers that
  implement this mitigation SHOULD use the same configuration information (such as
  the oprf_seed) for all clients; see {{preventing-client-enumeration}}. In settings
  where this attack is not a concern, servers may choose to not support this functionality.

# Implementation Considerations {#implementation-considerations}

Implementations of OPAQUE should consider addressing the following:

- Clearing secrets out of memory: All private key material and intermediate values,
including the outputs of the key exchange phase, should not be retained in memory after
deallocation.
- Constant-time operations: All operations, particularly the cryptographic and group
arithmetic operations, should be constant-time and independent of the bits of any secrets.
This includes any conditional branching during the creation of the credential response,
to support implementations which provide mitigations against client enumeration attacks.
- Deserialization checks: When parsing messages that have crossed trust boundaries (e.g.
a network wire), implementations should properly handle all error conditions covered in
{{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}} and abort accordingly.

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

OPAQUE is defined as the composition of two functionalities: an OPRF and
an AKE protocol. It can be seen as a "compiler" for transforming any AKE
protocol (with KCI security and forward secrecy; see below)
into a secure aPAKE protocol. In OPAQUE, the client stores a secret private key at the
server during password registration and retrieves this key each time
it needs to authenticate to the server. The OPRF security properties
ensure that only the correct password can unlock the private key
while at the same time avoiding potential offline guessing attacks.
This general composability property provides great flexibility and
enables a variety of OPAQUE instantiations, from optimized
performance to integration with existing authenticated key exchange
protocols such as TLS.

## Security Analysis

Jarecki et al. {{OPAQUE}} proved the security of OPAQUE
in a strong aPAKE model that ensures security against pre-computation attacks
and is formulated in the Universal Composability (UC) framework {{Canetti01}}
under the random oracle model. This assumes security of the OPRF
function and the underlying key exchange protocol. In turn, the
security of the OPRF protocol from {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}} is proven
in the random oracle model under the One-More Diffie-Hellman assumption {{JKKX16}}.

OPAQUE's design builds on a line of work initiated in the seminal
paper of Ford and Kaliski {{FK00}} and is based on the HPAKE protocol
of Xavier Boyen {{Boyen09}} and the (1,1)-PPSS protocol from Jarecki
et al. {{JKKX16}}. None of these papers considered security against
pre-computation attacks or presented a proof of aPAKE security
(not even in a weak model).

The KCI property required from AKE protocols for use with OPAQUE
states that knowledge of a party's private key does not allow an attacker
to impersonate others to that party. This is an important security
property achieved by most public-key based AKE protocols, including
protocols that use signatures or public key encryption for
authentication. It is also a property of many implicitly
authenticated protocols, e.g., HMQV, but not all of them. We also note that
key exchange protocols based on shared keys do not satisfy the KCI
requirement, hence they are not considered in the OPAQUE setting.
We note that KCI is needed to ensure a crucial property of OPAQUE: even upon
compromise of the server, the attacker cannot impersonate the client to the
server without first running an exhaustive dictionary attack.
Another essential requirement from AKE protocols for use in OPAQUE is to
provide forward secrecy (against active attackers).

## Related Protocols

Despite the existence of multiple designs for (PKI-free) aPAKE protocols,
none of these protocols are secure against pre-computation attacks.
This includes protocols that have recent analyses in the UC model such
as AuCPace {{AuCPace}} and SPAKE2+ {{SPAKE2plus}}. In particular, none
of these protocols can use the standard technique against pre-computation
that combines secret random values ("salt") into the one-way password mappings.
Either these protocols do not use a salt at all or, if they do, they
transmit the salt from server to client in the clear, hence losing the
secrecy of the salt and its defense against pre-computation.

sWe note that as shown in {{OPAQUE}}, these protocols, and any aPAKE
in the model from {{GMR06}}, can be converted into an aPAKE secure against
pre-computation attacks at the expense of an additional OPRF execution.

Beyond AuCPace and SPAKE2+, the most widely deployed PKI-free aPAKE is SRP {{?RFC2945}},
which is vulnerable to pre-computation attacks, lacks proof of security, and is
less efficient than OPAQUE. Moreover, SRP requires a ring as it mixes addition and
multiplication operations, and thus does not work over standard elliptic curves.
OPAQUE is therefore a suitable replacement for applications that use SRP.

## Identities {#identities}

AKE protocols generate keys that need to be uniquely and verifiably bound to a pair
of identities. In the case of OPAQUE, those identities correspond to client_identity and server_identity.
Thus, it is essential for the parties to agree on such identities, including an
agreed bit representation of these identities as needed.

Applications may have different policies about how and when identities are
determined. A natural approach is to tie client_identity to the identity the server uses
to fetch envelope (hence determined during password registration) and to tie server_identity
to the server identity used by the client to initiate an offline password
registration or online authenticated key exchange session. server_identity and client_identity can also
be part of the envelope or be tied to the parties' public keys. In principle, identities
may change across different sessions as long as there is a policy that
can establish if the identity is acceptable or not to the peer. However, we note
that the public keys of both the server and the client must always be those defined
at the time of password registration.

The client identity (client_identity) and server identity (server_identity) are
optional parameters that are left to the application to designate as aliases for
the client and server. If the application layer does not supply values for these
parameters, then they will be omitted from the creation of the envelope
during the registration stage. Furthermore, they will be substituted with
client_identity = client_public_key and server_identity = server_public_key during
the authenticated key exchange stage.

The advantage to supplying a custom client_identity and server_identity (instead of simply relying
on a fallback to client_public_key and server_public_key) is that the client can then ensure that any
mappings between client_identity and client_public_key (and server_identity and server_public_key)
are protected by the authentication from the envelope. Then, the client can verify that the
client_identity and server_identity contained in its envelope match the client_identity
and server_identity supplied by the server.

However, if this extra layer of verification is unnecessary for the application, then simply
leaving client_identity and server_identity unspecified (and using client_public_key and
server_public_key instead) is acceptable.

## Export Key Usage {#export-key-usage}

The export key can be used (separately from the OPAQUE protocol) to provide
confidentiality and integrity to other data which only the client should be
able to process. For instance, if the server is expected to maintain any
client-side secrets which require a password to access, then this export key
can be used to encrypt these secrets so that they remain hidden from the
server.

## Static Diffie-Hellman Oracles

While one can expect the practical security of the OPRF function (namely,
the hardness of computing the function without knowing the key) to be in the
order of computing discrete logarithms or solving Diffie-Hellman, Brown and
Gallant {{BG04}} and Cheon {{Cheon06}} show an attack that slightly improves
on generic attacks. For typical curves, the attack requires an infeasible
number of calls to the OPRF or results in insignificant security loss;
see {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}} for more information. For OPAQUE, these attacks
are particularly impractical as they translate into an infeasible number of
failed authentication attempts directed at individual users.

## Input Validation {#validation}

Both client and server MUST validate the other party's public key(s) used
for the execution of OPAQUE. This includes the keys shared during the
offline registration phase, as well as any keys shared during the online
key agreement phase. The validation procedure varies depending on the
type of key. For example, for OPAQUE instantiations
using 3DH with P-256, P-384, or P-521 as the underlying group, validation
is as specified in Section 5.6.2.3.4 of {{keyagreement}}. This includes
checking that the coordinates are in the correct range, that the point
is on the curve, and that the point is not the point at infinity.
Additionally, validation MUST ensure the Diffie-Hellman shared secret is
not the point at infinity.

## OPRF Hardening

Hardening the output of the OPRF greatly increases the cost of an offline
attack upon the compromise of the credential file at the server. Applications
SHOULD select parameters that balance cost and complexity. Note that in
OPAQUE, the hardening function is executed by the client, as opposed to
the server. This means that applications must consider a tradeoff between the
performance of the protocol on clients (specifically low-end devices) and
protection against offline attacks after a server compromise.

## Client Enumeration {#preventing-client-enumeration}

Client enumeration refers to attacks where the attacker tries to learn
extra information about the behavior of clients that have registered with
the server. There are two types of attacks we consider:

1) An attacker tries to learn whether a given client identity is registered
with a server, and
2) An attacker tries to learn whether a given client identity has recently
completed registration, re-registered (e.g. after a password change), or
changed its identity.

OPAQUE prevents these attacks during the authentication flow. The first is
prevented by requiring servers to act with unregistered client identities in a
way that is indistinguishable from its behavior with existing registered clients.
Servers do this for an unregistered client by simulating a fake
CredentialResponse as specified in {{create-credential-response}}.
Implementations must also take care to avoid side-channel leakage (e.g., timing
attacks) from helping differentiate these operations from a regular server
response. Note that this may introduce possible abuse vectors since the
server's cost of generating a CredentialResponse is less than that of the
client's cost of generating a CredentialRequest. Server implementations
may choose to forego the construction of a simulated credential response
message for an unregistered client if these client enumeration attacks can
be mitigated through other application-specific means or are otherwise not
applicable for their threat model.

Preventing the second type of attack requires the server to supply a
credential_identifier value for a given client identity, consistently between
the registration response and credential response; see {{create-reg-response}}
and {{create-credential-response}}. Note that credential_identifier can be set
to client_identity for simplicity.

In the event of a server compromise that results in a re-registration of
credentials for all compromised clients, the oprf_seed value MUST be resampled,
resulting in a change in the oprf_key value for each client. Although this
change can be detected by an adversary, it is only leaked upon password rotation
after the exposure of the credential files, and equally affects all registered
clients.

Finally, applications must use the same key recovery mechanism when using this
prevention throughout their lifecycle. The envelope size may vary between
mechanisms, so a switch could then be detected.

OPAQUE does not prevent either type of attack during the registration flow.
Servers necessarily react differently during the registration flow between
registered and unregistered clients. This allows an attacker to use the server's
response during registration as an oracle for whether a given client identity is
registered. Applications should mitigate against this type of attack by rate
limiting or otherwise restricting the registration flow.

## Password Salt and Storage Implications

In OPAQUE, the OPRF key acts as the secret salt value that ensures the infeasibility
of pre-computation attacks. No extra salt value is needed. Also, clients never
disclose their passwords to the server, even during registration. Note that a corrupted
server can run an exhaustive offline dictionary attack to validate guesses for the client's
password; this is inevitable in any aPAKE protocol. (OPAQUE enables defense against such
offline dictionary attacks by distributing the server so that an offline attack is only
possible if all - or a minimal number of - servers are compromised {{OPAQUE}}.) Furthermore,
if the server does not sample this OPRF key with sufficiently high entropy, or if it is not
kept hidden from an adversary, then any derivatives from the client's password may also be
susceptible to an offline dictionary attack to recover the original password.

Some applications may require learning the client's password for enforcing password
rules. Doing so invalidates this important security property of OPAQUE and is
NOT RECOMMENDED. Applications should move such checks to the client. Note that
limited checks at the server are possible to implement, e.g., detecting repeated
passwords.

# Alternate Key Recovery Mechanisms {#alternate-key-recovery}

Client authentication material can be stored and retrieved using different key
recovery mechanisms, provided these mechanisms adhere to the requirements
specified in {{deps-keyrec}}. Any key recovery mechanism that encrypts data
in the envelope MUST use an authenticated encryption scheme with random
key-robustness (or key-committing). Deviating from the key-robustness
requirement may open the protocol to attacks, e.g., {{LGR20}}.
This specification enforces this property by using a MAC over the envelope
contents.

We remark that export_key for authentication or encryption requires
no special properties from the authentication or encryption schemes
as long as export_key is used only after authentication material is successfully
recovered, i.e., after the MAC in RecoverCredentials passes verification.

# Alternate AKE Instantiations {#alternate-akes}

It is possible to instantiate OPAQUE with other AKEs, such as HMQV {{HMQV}} and SIGMA-I.
HMQV is similar to 3DH but varies in its key schedule. SIGMA-I uses digital signatures
rather than static DH keys for authentication. Specification of these instantiations is
left to future documents. A sketch of how these instantiations might change is included
in the next subsection for posterity.

OPAQUE may also be instantiated with any post-quantum (PQ) AKE protocol that has the message
flow above and security properties (KCI resistance and forward secrecy) outlined
in {{security-considerations}}. Note that such an instantiation is not quantum-safe unless
the OPRF is quantum-safe. However, an OPAQUE instantiation where the AKE is quantum-safe,
but the OPRF is not, would still ensure the confidentiality of application data encrypted
under session_key (or a key derived from it) with a quantum-safe encryption function.

## HMQV Instantiation Sketch

An HMQV instantiation would work similar to OPAQUE-3DH, differing primarily in the key
schedule {{HMQV}}. First, the key schedule `preamble` value would use a different constant prefix
-- "HMQV" instead of "3DH" -- as shown below.

~~~
preamble = concat("HMQV",
                  I2OSP(len(client_identity), 2), client_identity,
                  KE1,
                  I2OSP(len(server_identity), 2), server_identity,
                  KE2.inner_ke2)
~~~

Second, the IKM derivation would change. Assuming HMQV is instantiated with a cyclic
group of prime order p with bit length L, clients would compute `IKM` as follows:

~~~
u' = (eskU + u \* skU) mod p
IKM = (epkS \* pkS^s)^u'
~~~

Likewise, servers would compute `IKM` as follows:

~~~
s' = (eskS + s \* skS) mod p
IKM = (epkU \* pkU^u)^s'
~~~

In both cases, `u` would be computed as follows:

~~~
hashInput = concat(I2OSP(len(epkU), 2), epkU,
                   I2OSP(len(info), 2), info,
                   I2OSP(len("client"), 2), "client")
u = Hash(hashInput) mod L
~~~

Likewise, `s` would be computed as follows:

~~~
hashInput = concat(I2OSP(len(epkS), 2), epkS,
                   I2OSP(len(info), 2), info,
                   I2OSP(len("server"), 2), "server")
s = Hash(hashInput) mod L
~~~

Hash is the same hash function used in the main OPAQUE protocol for key derivation.
Its output length (in bits) must be at least L.

## SIGMA-I Instantiation Sketch

A SIGMA-I instantiation differs more drastically from OPAQUE-3DH since authentication
uses digital signatures instead of Diffie Hellman. In particular, both KE2 and KE3
would carry a digital signature, computed using the server and client private keys
established during registration, respectively, as well as a MAC, where the MAC is
computed as in OPAQUE-3DH.

The key schedule would also change. Specifically, the key schedule `preamble` value would
use a different constant prefix -- "SIGMA-I" instead of "3DH" -- and the `IKM` computation
would use only the ephemeral key shares exchanged between client and server.

# Test Vectors

This section contains real and fake test vectors for the OPAQUE-3DH specification.
Each real test vector in {{real-vectors}} specifies the configuration information,
protocol inputs, intermediate values computed during registration and authentication,
and protocol outputs.

Similarly, each fake test vector in {{fake-vectors}} specifies
the configuration information, protocol inputs, and protocol
outputs computed during authentication of an unknown or unregistered user. Note that `masking_key`, `client_private_key`, and
`client_public_key` are used as additional inputs as described in
{{create-credential-response}}. `client_public_key` is used as the fake record's public key, and
`masking_key` for the fake record's masking key parameter.

All values are encoded in hexadecimal strings. The configuration information
includes the (OPRF, Hash, MHF, EnvelopeMode, Group) tuple, where the Group
matches that which is used in the OPRF. These test vectors were generated using
draft-06 of {{I-D.irtf-cfrg-voprf}}.
